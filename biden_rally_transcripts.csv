My name is Joe Biden. 
I was born in Mercy Hospital in Scranton. By the way, you have no idea how that old expression, when my dad lived up here and we had to move because things kind of fell apart in terms of jobs, but my great grandfather, Edward Francis Blewitt, was the first Irish-Catholics elected to the state senate in the state of Pennsylvania from Scranton in 1907. It’s a long, long history, but it’s good to be home. One of the things, I know everybody says, “Why do you keep calling it home?” Well, I left here when I was going into the fourth grade, but I came home almost all summer, every summer. 
When I got married to my deceased wife, my wedding party was seven people, five of them are friends from Scranton. I grew up here. So Scranton’s where I learned, like you did, all my basic values. I learned at my grandpa’s table at 2446 North Washington Avenue, that money did not determine your wealth. I learned that if you want anything to do it, then do it when you set your mind to it. I learned that basic responsibility everybody had was just to look out, just to look for the other guy, look out at what’s going on, beware what’s going on. 
My dad used to have an expression when we left Scranton and moved down to Delaware. He said, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s like your dignity. It’s about respect, it’s about your place in the community. It’s about who you are. It’s about being [inaudible 00:01:49] and how it’s going to be okay.” Well, guess what, an awful lot of people can’t say that now. A lot of people can’t look at their kids now and say it’s going to be okay. 
I ran for three reasons and I’m going to stop and not keep you out here. Number one, I said when I announced that I wanted to restore the soul of the country, but I wasn’t being melodramatic. All I meant was restore basic decency and honor to the White House. When I saw those folk come out of those fields down in Charlottesville, carrying those torches and you close your eyes and remember what you saw, [inaudible 00:02:34]. They were carrying Nazi flags and talking about how [inaudible 00:02:40]. This country’s soul is so black with prejudice that it just… That’s when I decided I had to run. That’s when my granddaughter and the other three of them came to see me, after that happened, because they knew I was going to say, “Poppy’s got to run. We know it’s going to ugly.” Because their whole life, they’ve either had a father who was the Attorney General of the State of Delaware or a Grandpop who was the senator or Vice President. That’s why we ran. 
The second reason we ran is we’ve got to restore the backbone of the country. You all know it. The middle class built this country. Wall Street didn’t build it, the middle class built it. And Unions built the middle class. They’re getting clobbered right now. They’re getting clobbered. The third reason I’m running, is what I want to update about today and that is uniting this country. 
We have to unite the country and we can do it. I think the country’s ready. But I basically came to say thank you and thank you and thank you. 
It’s no sacrifice, it’s the greatest honor in my life. It’s the greatest honor in my life. I’m sure the mayor and Bobby feel the same way about serving. It’s a great honor. I want to thank you all and I know you’re out canvasing, knock on three or four thousand doors, we’ll have no problem. No, I’m only kidding with you. Exactly what you’ve done, I really appreciate it."

Joe’s here. Jill’s here. Doug’s here. You are here. We are here. And we are here to bring this election home, 
But we got one more day. That is it. One more day. And I’ll tell you, Joe and I are just so grateful, so grateful for your support; for your prayers; for your love; for your time volunteering, making calls; for your trust in us and for your vote. And as we head into tomorrow, I know we are empowered. We are optimistic about our future. We know the strength of unity. We know the strength of America. 
You know, when Joe asked me to join this ticket, saying yes was an easy decision. He and I, we come from different backgrounds, but we were raised with the same values: hard work, honesty, decency, a belief that we all have a responsibility to look out for one another. And those are the values I’ve seen as I’ve traveled across our country over the past 84 days, the values we share as Americans. 
Across our country, you can feel that something is happening. In big cities and small towns, wearing masks and socially distancing, I have seen people lining the streets and gathering on corners to show their support. They’re bringing the children, holding up signs, wearing their colors and strolling to the polls. And waving the red, white, and blue. 
The energy out there is real, and it is inspiring. In this battle for the very soul of our nation, we have seen what can be, unburdened by what has been. We have seen who we are and a willingness to fight for the country we love. And that is why I know that tomorrow, we are going to elect Joe Biden, the next President of the United States of America. 
So while we’re on the subject, tell me how many of you have already voted. Honk if you voted. And if you haven’t voted, go to iwillvote.com, and find out when and where you can vote tomorrow, because there is still almost 24 hours that we have got to get this done. And honk if you have been sending texts and making calls to get out the vote. Because we all know from the time the polls open tomorrow morning until they close, every minute counts. So, we cannot let up because it ain’t over until it’s over, and everything is at stake. Our health, our economy, our children’s futures, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, a criminal justice system that treats all people with dignity and equally under the law, a Supreme Court that advances the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, that lives up to the phrase above its entrance, “Equal justice under law.” 
The kind of country we want to be. That’s what’s at stake. It is all on the line. This is the most consequential election of our lifetimes, and the decision we make will, without any question, last for generations. 
And I’ll tell you, as I travel around, one of the biggest issues on everyone’s mind is the pandemic that is ravaging our country. And remember, back in January, Donald Trump knew just how bad the coronavirus was, that it was deadly and airborne. But what did he do with that information? He looks straight into the cameras at the American people and lied about it. He covered it up. 
Now, can you imagine what you would have done if you had known on January 28th, what he knew? What you might have done? What your family might’ve done to prepare? Can you imagine how our businesses, how our schools might have been able to prepare? How we as a country might have been able to prepare? 
But Donald Trump doesn’t think about what’s best for America. He only thinks about what is best for himself. And as a result, we have lost 230000 lives to COVID, so many people forced to die alone because of the nature of this virus. 230000 Americans. The last time we experienced loss like this was World War II. 
In addition, we’re looking at over 9 million people who have contracted the virus, and we know it’s hitting communities of color the hardest. Latinos are contracting COVID at three times the rate of others. Black folks are dying at twice the rate of others. 
And let’s be clear, we are also in the worst economic crisis we have faced since the Great Depression, because Donald Trump failed to contain this virus. He failed to lead. 23 million people are receiving unemployment. One in five mothers with a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry in America. In one in six households, folks are behind on their rent and concerned they may not be able to pay rent. One in four small businesses have closed. 
And yet, nine months into this pandemic, this president still doesn’t have a plan to contain it. We have witnessed the greatest failure of a presidential administration in America’s history. On top of it all, President Trump is in court right now, trying to end the Affordable Care Act and take health coverage away from over 20 million Americans. He’s trying to end protections for the over 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions, conditions like asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer. Honk if you know somebody, raise your hand if you know somebody with diabetes or high blood pressure or asthma or breast cancer. Because this fight includes a fight for them. 
America, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. And the first thing Joe and I will do when we are in the white house is get this virus under control. We will listen to the scientists and public health experts. We will provide free testing and treatment, and when it is available, a safe vaccine for all. We will provide schools with the guidance and resources they need to reopen safely, and we will build back an economy that actually works for working people. 
Let me be clear, Joe and I will not increase taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year, period. But we will ask the super wealthy and biggest corporations to pay their fair share, and we will invest those tax dollars to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, to tackle the climate crisis and create millions of good paying union jobs, make childcare more affordable and invest in our nation’s schools and in our nation’s teachers. We will build on Obamacare and expand access to health care to tens of millions of Americans, including expanding mental health care. Because we understand the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and it deserves the health that all people need. 
And we will lower prescription drug costs, and protect and expand Medicare and Social Security. And we will work to root out the systemic racism that still exists in our criminal justice system. And we will confront, not condone, white supremacy, and fight for economic justice, no matter your zip code or your race. 
And Pennsylvania, we will begin the work of healing and repairing and uniting our nation, Democrats and Republicans and Independents, and people of all races and all backgrounds. Because we know that’s how we’ve always overcome our greatest challenges, together. 
And Joe gets that. Joe understands that. You see, Joe is a leader who understands what the American people are going through. He sees us and he understands suffering because he has experienced so much of it himself. Joe Biden is a leader of both strength and empathy, toughness and humility. He understands that the measure of a person’s strength is not based on who you put down. It’s measured based on who you lift up. 
And he knows that no matter where we come from or where we live, no matter your race, gender, background or faith, no matter how we identify or who we love, no matter the language your grandmother speaks, what we have in common is so much stronger than what divides us. And that is the kind of leader America needs right now, and that is why, Pennsylvania, we must win this election. 
So remember this, your vote is your voice and your voice is your power. Don’t let anyone ever take your power from you. Now is the time to stand up. Now is the time to speak out, and now is the time to vote, and vote like our lives depend on it because they do. 
Our democracy is always going to be as strong. America, our democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And in this election, let’s vote like our democracy depends on it. Vote like justice, equality and opportunity, decency, character and dignity are on the ballot because they are. 
And one day, one day, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look us in the eye, each one of us, and they will ask us, “What did you do at that moment?” And I want to be able to say, “We did everything we could to fight for our country and their future.” 
So, let’s do that. Let’s vote, and vote with conviction and confidence and hope. And let’s elect Joe Biden, the next President of the United States. Thank you. May God bless you, and may God bless America. 
Please welcome back to the stage, Lady Gaga. 
Please welcome business agent for Laborers’ Union Local 1058, John Duffy. 
What’s going on, Pittsburgh? Hey. Good evening, everyone. My name’s John Duffy. I’m fourth generation union strong here in Pittsburgh. I’m a business agent at Laborers’ Local 1058, where I’ve been a proud member for 11 years. 
Four years ago, guys, President Trump promised Western PA he would create jobs, but today there are 300,000 fewer jobs in the state than when Barack Obama and Joe Biden left office. He campaigned in Western Pennsylvania in 2016, promising major infrastructure build, infrastructure made with American steel right here in Pittsburgh, but he never even really tried to deliver. Instead, he spent his time giving tax breaks to Wall Street and the super wealthy, while undermining unions and leaving working families behind. From the highest office in the world, he has fanned the flames of racial tension, putting the lives of so many people that looked like me in danger. 
We cannot go on like this. We cannot stand for a president who thinks it’s fine to keep workers down, so long as the numbers on the stock market keep going up. We cannot keep waiting to hear what he will say next to deepen the racial division that is in this country. We need to stand up and elect the only candidate in this race who shares the values of working people and will empower us to succeed. That’s Joe Biden. 
Joe understands the struggles that working communities face because Joe is one of us. He’s from Pennsylvania. Scranton’s not that far away. He grew up in a working class family. The values that Joe learned in Scranton, hard work, toughness, empathy, are the same values that he carried throughout his life as a public servant and they’re the same values that he’s going to take with him to the White House. As president, Joe’s going to help communities recover from the coronavirus and then put working people in Western PA and across this country at the center of the effort to build back a better economy. He’s going to create millions of good paying jobs and his- 
He’s going to create millions of good-paying jobs. And as president, he will encourage unionization and collective bargaining because he knows that workers in unions, not Wall Street, built this country. Joe is going to work to ensure that all people, regardless of their race, who they love, or what they do for a living, are treated with the equal amount of dignity and respect. 
We are now a matter of hours away, guys, from the end of this election, and the work that we do tomorrow will determine whether we put a champion for the working class people in office or we continue to be pushed around by President Trump. See, to me, guys, the choice is easy. So tomorrow let’s get a plan, let’s go out, and let’s vote. And let’s vote for Joe Biden. Pittsburgh, help me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Joe Biden. 
Whoa. Hello, Pittsburgh. I’m Jill Biden’s husband and Lady Gaga’s friend. We go back a while. One thing I wasn’t going to say, but I’ll said now, she spent a lot of time helping me with the Violence Against Women Act and helping so many women who needed help. God love you, you’re wonderful. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
Folks. John, thanks, old buddy, for sharing your story. And thanks to Mr. Mayor. I don’t know where you are, I can’t see out here, but I’ll tell you what, thanks for the passport into town. And thanks for all the speakers we heard tonight, as well as the incredible, as I said, Lady Gaga. I don’t know whether … You couldn’t see, but all my grandkids are over there, Lady Gaga. And when you were singing, knew every word of every song. They were jumping and moving. I got to get a picture with them. Anyway. 
My buddy Congressman Mike Doyle, Governor Tom Wolf, thank you for standing with me and fighting for the dignity of working people. Everyone you’ve heard from across the state, as well as in Philadelphia, we hear you loud. We hear clearly. Congressman Boyle been with me a while. Remarkable, great friend and friend of his family. His dad and I grew up five blocks away from one another in Scranton. 
Bobby Casey, Patti LaBelle, and John Legend. My Lord, John, I’m voting for you after I heard that speech you made. Look at the second future gentleman, Doug. Doug, I love you. You are a good man. And I want to thank the next vice president of the United States, a woman I am so proud to be running alongside of, Kamala Harris. 
Look, I know as a Scranton boy and then raised on the border of Southern Pennsylvania in Claymont, Delaware, I know it’s not always easy to bring Western and Eastern Pennsylvania together. But you know what, the Steelers got a big win yesterday, and the Eagles got a big win last night, so we can both be happy. And folks, I have a feeling we’re coming together for a big win tomorrow. 
My Lord, there’s a lot of you out here on this cold night. Thank you. And by the way, in the parking garage, don’t jump. I need you. Don’t jump. 
Folks, look, 18 months ago, we kicked off the campaign at Teamsters Local 249 right here in Pittsburgh. I chose Western Pennsylvania for my first stop as a candidate, and now for my last stop before Election Day, because you represent the backbone of this country. Hard work and families. We’re asking nothing but a fair shot, an even chance. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things. The qualities that built this country, that created and sustain the middle class. And by the way, as I said twice earlier today, unions built the middle class. 
Look. We’ve been through a lot in this country since we announced. America is facing a confluence of crises unlike anything in living memory. We’re still in the battle for the soul of America. Decency, honor, respect. Where has it gone with this president? Let me tell you something, folks. Tomorrow’s the beginning of a new day. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has left hardworking Americans out in the cold. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has divided this nation and fanned the flames of hate. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. 
Ladies and gentlemen, millions of Americans have already voted. Close to a hundred million. And millions more will vote tomorrow. And my message to you is simple: the power to change this country is in your hands. In your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing that’s going to stop the people of this nation from voting, period. And when America votes, America will be heard. And America’s heard. I believe the message to be loud and clear, it’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. I honest to God believe the vast majority of Americans are done with the chaos, the corruption, the failure, the irresponsibility, the indifference to American lives, the indifference to America’s dignity. We’ve got a lot of work to do. Not division and distraction, but real, real, real healing of this country. 
If you elect me your president, I’m going to heal this country, and we’re going to act. We’re going to act to get COVID under control beginning on day one. I’ll put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months. Masking, social distancing, testing, tracing. A plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and a vaccine, when it comes. 
Imagine where we could be if the president only wore a mask from the beginning instead of mocked it. I can tell you this, as every expert will tell you, we wouldn’t have 9 million COVID cases in this nation. We wouldn’t have over 230,000 deaths and nearly a hundred thousand cases nationwide just two days ago. We wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 predicted deaths in the next few months. That’s what the experts are telling us. We don’t change, 200,000 more people will die by the end of the year. 
The President knew in January, as Kamala said, that this virus was deadly, but he hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu, but he lied to us. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear. He kept telling us a miracle was coming, it’d be over by Easter. 
Last Friday, he had the gall to suggest that America’s doctors, who’ve been on the front lines of this crisis for nine months along with the nurses and so many other first responders, he suggested those doctors were falsely inflating the deaths due to COVID because they wanted more money. For God’s sake. No, I really mean it. Think about it. Our frontline healthcare workers, they’ve suffered and sacrificed for nine months, and this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. It’s a disgrace. And last night, Trump went on to say he was going to fire Dr. Fauci. Well, I’ve got a better idea. Let’s fire Trump, and I’ll hire Fauci. 
Think about it. Look, Donald Trump has waved the white flag of surrender. Remember he said, “I’m the commander- in-chief, and I’m going to fight this fight.” Give me a break. He waved the white flag of surrender. I’ll never surrender. We’re going to beat this virus. We’re going to get it under control. And the first step to beating this virus is beating Donald Trump. 
Folks. Well, let me tell you something. Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. As we say in my faith, bless me, Father, for he has … I don’t know. Jobs president. Here’s the truth. Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years, that’s a lot of presidents, the first president in 90 years to finish his term in office with fewer jobs than when he started. An independent analysis, not from some liberal think tank, but by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my plan will create 7 million more jobs and a trillion dollars more economic growth than anything the President has proposed. 
Folks, we can do this. I’m going to end Trump’s tax loopholes that incentivize companies to ship jobs overseas. That’s why there’s not as many jobs here. And I’m going to add a 10% surtax on any company that ships jobs overseas. But companies who invest in American manufacturing, bring jobs back, we’ll give them a 10% tax credit. 
And by the way, president of the United States awards about over $600 billion of contracts a year because of everything from building aircraft carriers to all that we do, all the government spends. I promise you this, and it violates no trade agreement, there will be no government contracts given out on my watch that don’t make all of their products here in America. The future will be right here in America, in Pennsylvania. 
Folks, Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, from Wall street. That’s all he can see. Well, I see it from Scranton, where I grew up. I see it from Pennsylvania and Delaware. Wall Street didn’t build this country; working people built the country, the middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. 
My dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joe, the only way you can deal with the abuse of power is with power.” Well, the only outfit that can deal with the abuse of power of corporate America are union power. That’s the only way it can be dealt with. And I warn you all, if I’m elected, you’re going to see the most pro-union president in American history sitting in the White House. 
Look. I believe we should be about rewarding work, not wealth. Under my plan, as Kamala said, if you make less than 400,000 bucks, you’re not going to pay a penny more in taxes. But finally, finally, the wealthiest among us, the biggest corporations, 91 of which of the Fortune 500 paid zero in income tax, you’re going to start paying your fair share. Why? Why should an iron worker, a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher tax rate than the super wealthy? 
Folks, and here’s a good one, why should you be paying more than Donald Trump pays in taxes? New York Times said he paid $750 in taxes one year. And guess what. When they asked him about it a little before that, he said the reason he only paid that is because he was smart, he knew how to game the system. Well, I’m sick of the wealthy guys gaming the system. Most are willing to pay their fair share, but let me tell you … 
By the way, he loves to talk about corruption. Oh, my Lord. He loves to talk about corruption. And you found out last week, he’s the only person I’ve ever heard of has a secret bank account in China where he paid, according to the Times, 50 times more taxes in Beijing than he did in the United States. Folks, as my mother would’ve said, enough is enough is enough. Look. We’re going to act to protect healthcare as well. Trump and the Republicans for the last 10 years have been trying like the devil to eliminate the healthcare plan. By the way, because of economic policies and so many companies going out of business, 10 million Americans have already lost their healthcare. 
And now Trump and the Republicans, they jam through a Supreme Court nominee for one overwhelming reason: they wanted to destroy the Affordable Care Act. If they get their way, by the way … This is not hyperbole. By the way, guess what’s going to happen. Seven days after tomorrow, they’re going to be in the Supreme Court arguing to wipe out, root and branch, all of the Affordable Care Act. Well, you can say that again because a lot of people are hurting. 
I can remember as a kid growing up in Claymont and Wilmington in a three-bedroom house, nice house, three-bedroom, split-level home with four kids and a grandpa. The walls were thin. I can remember one night, my dad, I could hear him restless in the room next to us, talking to my mom, and asking her the next morning, “What’s the matter?” She said, “Your dad, we just lost our health insurance.” How many people you know, staring at the ceiling, wondering what in God’s name are they going to do without health insurance? How many of them? How many … 
… without health insurance, how many of them? How many of them are worried like we were when our son came home from Iraq and was lying dying? I wonder what I would have done had they been able to come in, but for Obamacare and say, “Sorry, sorry, suffer the last month in the hospital in peace without your insurance, you’ve outrun your insurance.” How many people do you know? And many of you worry about it, worry about your kids, worry about what’s happening. Well, if they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for pre-existing conditions, including five million Pennsylvanians. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. Donald Trump, look, folks, being a great consumer of healthcare I feel very strongly about this. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s a right. 
I’ll not only restore healthcare, I’ll build on it. You can keep your private insurance if you have it, or you can choose a Medicare like option. We’re going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending, surprise billings. How are you going to do that? Because Trump and his buddies are going to pay more taxes so you don’t have to do more. And we’re going to reduce, if it didn’t sound so strange I wouldn’t even explain, you’re going to reduce prescription drug costs by 60%. You know how? By making sure Medicare can negotiate with the insurance companies for the cost of drugs. We’re going to make sure you keep the protections for pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, these guys are for real, unfortunately. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s announced what he’ll do if he gets re-elected with regard to social security. The actuary of social security has said if Trump were elected and gets passed what he wants it will bankrupt social security by 2023. Now, you all may think I’m making it up. But just like I said when Paul Ryan was the Speaker of the House. I said, “They’re going to cut Medicare,” and everybody looked, “No, no.” They tried to cut it by $5 billion right off the bat. Folks, these guys are serious. They’ve never fully supported these programs. I’ll protect social security, Medicare and Medicaid. You have my word on it. But folks, as we used to say in the Senate, if you excuse a point of personal privilege, there’s nothing that has made me more angry about this President than the way he’s spoken about those of you have served in uniform. Losers and suckers, he referred to you. 
Our son, Beau, his two children are with me tonight, he gave up his job as Attorney General to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the Speaker’s Service Medal, he came home with brain cancer. And guess what? He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot like all of your sons and daughters. It angers the hell out of me the way he talks about our veterans. Your parents, your grandparents, all who have served. To the best of my knowledge, he’s the first President of the United States who has six generals and admirals who worked in his administration who have since left and said he was unfit to be Commander-in-Chief. Folks, that’s my General Stanley McChrystal, a former commander of special operations who oversaw the Bin Laden raid, Admiral Bill McRaven, and 22 other four stars endorsed me because they know I’ll have their back. 
It’s not happened before. Trump likes to portray himself as a tough guy, the macho man. Wouldn’t you like to have a shot? Anyway, the macho man. And he says people listen to him because he’s tough around the world. When’s the last time you ever heard of a President of the United States literally being laughed out loud by world leaders when he spoke with United Nations? So much for listening to him. When was the last time a President of the United States met with the NATO leaders at the NATO Summit, other world leaders, chancellors, presidents, prime ministers, and before they realize it, they were all making fun of him as he left the room? Folks, and can you believe we have a President who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy? Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan, where I’ve been to many times. It’s a rough area, man. 
But Trump has talked to him six times since then and he’s been frightened to say or challenge him at all. Donald Trump isn’t strong, he’s weak. This is a President who not only does it not understand sacrifice, doesn’t understand courage, physical courage it takes to be in uniform. Folks, we’re going to support our military. They’re the backbone and spine of this country. Folks, we have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis. Donald Trump calls it a hoax. I call it about our health and the ability to create millions of good paying jobs right here in Western Pennsylvania. We can combat climate change with American ingenuity and manufacturing, creating millions of new high paying union jobs. Let me be clear, I will not ban fracking in Pennsylvania. I’ll protect those jobs, period, no matter what Donald Trump says. But I tell you what, I will, I will no longer fund oil companies with subsidies, period. 
Folks, we have to restore the backbone of this country, but we also have to unify. Look, we’re going to act to deliver racial justice in America. Protesting is not burning and looting. The violence will not be tolerated. But the protests, there’s a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace, they’re not going to be soon forgotten by me, not by anyone in this country. And they’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. When I met with Floyd’s family, when I went down to Texas, he has a little daughter, six years old, and I was in the room and I knelt down to talk to her. She looked at me and she said, “Mr. Vice President,” she said, “my daddy is going to change America. My daddy is going to change America.” Well, guess what? We also know that the American people realize we’ve got to change. We also know that justice isn’t just about criminal justice, it’s about knowing the true justice about jobs and building wealth for your families. No one should be working two jobs to stay in poverty. We need a minimum of $15 an hour minimum wage. And for people struggling, first term home buyers, they’re going to get a $15,000 tax credit from me. We’re going to provide capital for young entrepreneurs to start small businesses, provide free community college, which by the way, costs a lot of money, six billion a year. We spend about that much money giving breaks out for race horses, folks, as well as free tuition for students attending state universities if they come from families making less than 125 grand. Folks, we can do this, Pennsylvania. In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me and Barack. In 2020, I’m asking you seeking your trust again. I take nothing for granted. 
This is a battle for the soul of America. We have to win this. We have to win this together. Bring the country together. I’m proud of the coalition this campaign has built, welcoming Democrats and Republicans and independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. There will be no red states and blue states. There’ll be the United States of America. I promise you I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a President, the duty to care for everyone, the duty to heal. That’s the President’s job. So please vote. If you still have your absentee ballot, get into a drop box as soon as you can or vote tomorrow in person. Just make a plan and help get out the vote. The power is in your hands, Pennsylvania. 
And here’s the amazing thing, here’s the amazing thing about this moment in our history, the character of the country is on the ballot. On the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threats to who we are and what we believe that we’ve seen in our lifetimes. But on the other hand, our future has never been more promising. I’ve said it many times. I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I got invited and got elected as a 29 year old kid. And here’s why, we’re in a better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Fact, our workers are three times as productive. We have the biggest economy in the world, the strongest military in the history of the world, the most innovative entrepreneurs. We’re virtually energy dependent. We have more great research universities, out of which every major new changes come, than all the rest of the world combined, literally. 
No nation in the world can match us. We lead by the power of our example, not just example of our power. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No one else can challenge us. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign, dividing America, tearing us apart, pitting Americans against one another based on our race, our gender, our ethnicity, our religion. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. And folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lie after lie after lie. Folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this. We can be better than what we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
2,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/barack-obama-campaign-speech-for-joe-biden-transcript-miami-fl-november-2,"Barack Obama Campaign Speech for Joe Biden Transcript Miami, FL November 2","Hey. I’m back [inaudible 00:04:26]. Thank you. Thank you, guys. Can everybody please give Grace a big round of applause? That was fantastic. Let me tell you, I love nurses. Hey, you. I think we’ve all had the experience when a loved one’s gotten sick. I remember when Sasha was four months old and she suddenly had a temperature and she was crying and it was midnight. We called the pediatrician. He said, “Look, get her to the emergency room.” It turned out that she had meningitis, which for little babies is really a tough thing. We saw doctors and I was starting to tear up because my baby, I didn’t know what was going on. 
It was the nurses who kept Michelle and I steady, who cared after Sasha, who looked after them. Every time I meet a healthcare worker, I am grateful because every single one of us rely on them at some point in our lives. It’s because of their sacrifices and hard work that our families can rest easy. 
Hello? Is that working? That’s a sign that you guys need to get Grace a big round of applause. I love you, too. Miami, that’s why I came back. I was here just a few days ago, but then I realized there’s still some folks we need to vote. I’ve got one word for you: tomorrow. After four years of failure and division, we have the power to change America. Tomorrow you can put an end to the politics that tries to pull us apart just to win an election and that tries to peddle conspiracy theories and fear, when what we need is competence and hope. Tomorrow in the most important election of our lifetimes. I’ve been involved in some pretty important elections, like mine, but this one’s more important. Tomorrow, right here in South Florida, you can deliver the change that we need. But it’s going to take every single one of us. 
As Grace said, if you haven’t dropped off your ballot yet, don’t wait anymore. Drop it off. If you voted already, then you need to get your friends and family to the polls. If you need to find out where, you can go to iowavote.com. Help them to make a plan to vote. Florida, you delivered for me twice and now I’m asking you to deliver for all of us and elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next president and vice president of the United States of America. 
Now, listen. I got to campaign with Joe over the weekend. It felt like the old days. I can’t wait to see him back in the White House because for eight years, he was the last person who left the room whenever I faced a big decision and he made me a better president. He has the character and the experience to make us a better country. He and Kamala are going to be in the fight, not for themselves, but for every single one of us. We can’t say that about the president right now. Now I never thought that Donald Trump would share my vision or embrace all of my policies, but I hoped for the sake of the country that he might take the job seriously. That he’d put in the work, but he hasn’t. He hasn’t shown any interest in taking seriously the work that is involved being president or helping anybody but his friends or himself or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show that he can use to get himself attention. 
The rest of us had to live with the consequences and Grace talked about those consequences, 230,000 Americans dead. More than a 100,000 small businesses closed. Half a million jobs gone here in Florida and his chief of staff, he’s admitted what we knew all along. He was quoted just a few days ago. He says, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” That’s a quote. We noticed. 
America just had its single worst week of new cases. What’s Trump’s closing argument? Last night, this last night on his COVID spreader tour, he’s a super spreader. He just goes around because nothing’s more important to him than crowds to make him feel good, as opposed to trying to keep the American people safe. Last night, he told his supporters, “Don’t tell anybody, but I’m going to fire Dr. Fauci after the election.” Don’t boo. Vote. You know. 
Just in case you were worried he was taking COVID too seriously, now we find out his intention is to eliminate from administration one of the world’s leading experts in infectious disease, but one guy who’s taking it seriously all along that he hasn’t been paying attention to. He’s been listening to the guy, apparently who thinks injecting bleach might be a good idea, but not the actual expert on infectious disease. They want to move out the scientists and the doctors who unders-… 
[inaudible 00:11:00], and the doctors who understand this disease and [inaudible 00:11:05] people or maintain folks who don’t know what they’re doing. Essentially, their closing argument when it comes to COVID is you ain’t seen nothing yet. But this is the last chance, this is his last chance to explain why we should give him four more years, and what you hear him talking about is his inauguration crowd being smaller than mine. After four years, that’s what he’s still worrying about. Let it go. What is his obsession with crowd size? Does he have nothing better to worry about? Did No one come to his birthday party when he was a kid? 
Look, that’s the difference between Joe and Donald Trump right there. That’s the difference. Joe cares about you and your safety and your security. Trump cares about feeding his ego. I understand the President wants to take full credit for the economy he inherited, but zero blame for the pandemic he ignored, but the job doesn’t work that way. Tweeting at the TV doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t make things better. You got to have a plan. You got to put in the work. 
And along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies to turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality. He takes this pandemic seriously. He knows how much it hurts for grandparents and grandkids who can’t see each other and hug each other. He’s not going to screw up testing. He’s not going to call scientists idiots or put people at risk, or, as he did just a few days ago, accuse medical professionals like Grace of trying to profit from the pandemic after all they’ve been through. Ridiculous. Shameful. Come on. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing and a vaccine free for every American, and make sure frontline heroes like Greg never have to ask other countries for the equipment they need. And his plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic, and makes sure that small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. 
Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy. America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama/Biden administration than in the first three years of his, and that was before he could blame the pandemic. We handed the longest streak of job growth in American history. The economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the only president since the Great Depression to actually lose jobs. 
He talks about Black unemployment, says he’s the best president for Black folks since Abe Lincoln. Really? [inaudible 00:03:10]. His son-in-law says, “Black folks, they have to want to be successful. That’s the problem.” That’s the problem? Really? Like 300 years of history is not the problem. 
Listen, when it came to the economy, Black unemployment almost at 17% during the Great Recession 10 years ago. Through hard work, Joe and I helped to get it down to 7.8% by the time we left the office, and it kept on going down, not because Trump did anything. This year, it’s soared back up to 17% here in Florida. 
His buddies at Mar-a-Lago may be better off than they were four years ago with the massive tax cuts he gave them, but ordinary families here in Florida, they didn’t see that. Now, he won’t extend release to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent, or having trouble making payments on their student loans, or just putting food on the table because of this pandemic. 
And Joe Biden understands the key to a strong economy isn’t more tax cuts for billionaires, it’s lifting up the prospects of work in America so that everybody has a chance to succeed. And that’s what Joe’s got, a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs to protect Florida from climate change, to secure environmental justice. And he’ll pay for those plans by rolling back Trump’s tax cuts for billionaires. 
And Joe doesn’t just want to get back to where we were. He sees this as a chance to make long overdue changes in the economy so everybody’s life is a little bit easy, whether it’s the waitress trying to raise her own kid on her own, or the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester’s classes, or the shift worker that’s worried about getting laid off, or the cancer survivor who’s worried about her preexisting condition protections being taken away. 
Florida, I need to talk to you about healthcare for a second because maybe what Grace said, you guys didn’t hear. I want to remind you of this. Republicans love say right before an election that they’ll protect your preexisting conditions. You know what? Joe and I actually protected them 10 years ago with the Affordable Care Art. Hispanics saw bigger gains in coverage than anybody else. Almost 93% of Hispanic kids got covered, an all-time high. 
Under this administration, Hispanic kids have lost coverage. Republicans have tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 60 times. Think about that. Why would you make that your mission, taking people’s healthcare away, and with no plan. They promise. They say, “Don’t worry. When we get rid of this plan, we’ll give you a better plan.” They’ve been promising that for 10 years now. They still don’t have one. I keep on looking for it. I’ve looked for it everywhere. You know, between the cushions and the couch. It’s nowhere to be found. Instead, they’ve attacked the Affordable Care Act at every time. They’ve driven up costs, they’ve driven up the uninsured. Now, they’re trying to get the Supreme Court to take your healthcare away in the middle of a pandemic, at a time when families need it the most, with nothing but empty promises to take its place. 
And think about what that would do to families right here in South Florida. Miami Dade has the highest enrollment under Obamacare of any county in Florida. Florida has the highest enrollment of any state in America. So when Trump last week flat out says he hopes the Supreme Court overturns Obamacare, what he’s saying is he wants to take your health insurance away. He just said it. 
Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare. Joe and Kamala will expand Medicare. Joe and Kamala will make insurance more affordable than everybody because Joe understands that the president’s first job is to keep us safe from all threats; foreign, domestic, and microscopic. 
So when the daily intelligence briefings that our president gets every morning has a flashing warning lights saying there’s a virus coming, the president can’t be AWOL. When Russia puts bounties on our soldiers’ heads, the commander-in-chief can’t be MIA. Joe Biden would never call our troops suckers or losers because he understands that’s somebody’s kid, somebody’s spouse, somebody’s mom or dad. 
When a hurricane devastates Puerto Rico, a president is supposed to help rebuild, not toss paper towels, not suggest selling Puerto Rico, not withhold billions of dollars until just before an election. 
(silence) 
[inaudible 00:20:51] tomorrow. Don’t boo. No, that’s not something you want to hear in Little Havana or Little Haiti. That’s not something that a leader of a democracy does. That’s something that a two bit dictator does. If you believe in democracy, you want every vote counted. 
Joe Biden will restore our battered standing in the world because he knows our true strength comes from setting an example the world wants to follow, and that’s a nation that stands with democracy and not dictators, a nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease, and stand up for human rights, whether it’s in Cuba or anywhere else around the world, including human rights right here in the United States of America. 
And here’s the other thing. You know, I’ve joked about this, but everybody says that’s a good point. They say that. With Joe and Kamala, you’re not going to have to think- 
It’s a good point. They said, “With Joe and Kamala, you’re not going to have to think about them every single day.” You’re not going to have to argue about some crazy tweet that the president sent out this morning. It won’t be so exhausting. You’ll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president’s doing his job instead of suggesting we inject bleach. That the president’s not going to re-Tweet conspiracy theories that the Navy Seals didn’t actually kill Bin Laden. We’re not going to have a president who goes out of his way to insult people just because they don’t agree with him. It’s not normal behavior, South Florida. We wouldn’t put up with this from a teacher, or a high school principal, or our coworker. Why would we accept it from the president of the United States? 
Because there are consequences when somebody behaves that way, when the person who’s supposed to be a top leader acts like that. It [inaudible 00:23:11] other people to be mean, and cruel, and dismissive, and racist. And it frays the fabric of all of our lives. And it affects how our kids see the world. And it affects our families and how they get along. It affects how the world sees America. And that’s why Joe talks about the soul of America. And that more than anything is what separates him from his opponent. And that’s what’s at stake in this election. Joe Biden cares about every American. And Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and I think you, those of you who are out there listening, I think he tries to live up to the values that we cherish, that we were taught of honesty, and hard work, and kindness, and humility, and responsibility, and giving somebody a hand up when they’re down. 
Wasn’t that what you were taught? That’s what I was taught. And we don’t always do it perfectly. Sometimes, we make mistakes in our own lives and our own families, but we try to own up to it. We try to make ourselves better. We try to [inaudible 00:24:27] kids to do the right thing, right? And when you’re like Joe Biden, that’s what you’ll see reflected in the White House. And these are not Republican or Democratic values. I was talking, we were flying over… Because we were Georgia earlier today, and I was telling my staff, “If there was a Democrat who was behaving this way, the way our current president does, I couldn’t support him.” If I saw a Democrat who was lying every single day. I mean, the fact checkers can’t keep up. Just over and over again. 
You know what I would say [inaudible 00:25:18]? That’s not the example I want. I don’t trust that person to manage the country’s affairs because it’s violating the values that we try to live by, and these are values we try to teach our kids. They’re not white values. They’re not black values. They’re not Latino values, or Asian American values, or Native American values. They’re American values. And we have to reclaim that. 
Some of you saw some folks that there was a Biden Harris bus in Texas. And they were surrounded by Trump cars and supporters. And at some point, some of it got dangerous, right? Looked like folks might be run off the road. And the president can’t be responsible for every single person out there, but he didn’t say, “That’s wrong.” He didn’t say, “In our democracy, there’s no place for that kind of intimidation, or violence, or reckless behavior.” He said, “Yeah, that’s great. [inaudible 00:04:44].” I mean, what’s going to happen to this country and our democracy if our leaders, when folks act recklessly, and dangerously, and irresponsibly, think that’s okay, think that’s fine? 
Imagined if I [inaudible 00:27:08] when I was president. Imagine if that was reversed. Imagine if I had gone around in rallies saying, “Yeah, intimidate folks. We’re going to send folks out and make sure it’s harder for them to vote.” People would have said, Democrats would have said, “That’s wrong.” Well, you know what? This is wrong. And it needs to change. And you have the power to change it. But if we’re going to change it, we’ve got to turn out like never before. 
We can leave no doubt. We can’t afford to be complacent. Not this time, not in this election. The reason I’m back here, South Florida, is because I know some of you have not voted yet. Some of you haven’t voted yet. Some of your friends, probably all of you who are here have voted. But some of you who are hearing me right now, some of you haven’t voted yet. And it’s not because the guy in the office is doing a good job. It’s not because you don’t see the pain that’s going around because this pandemic has been mishandled. But it’s because you’re skeptical that your vote’s going to make a difference. Or you’re just frustrated because you don’t think government can make a difference. 
And so, I want to talk to you. I don’t know what your circumstances are, but if you’re hearing me right now, you haven’t voted yet, I want you to understand that a president can’t solve every problem. Government can’t solve every problem. But you know what it can do, is if you have people in there who care about you, it can make things better. If we elect a House, and a Senate, and a State House, and the State Senate that are focused on working people and getting them the help that they need, it can make a difference. I wasn’t able to make sure that everybody in America got health insurance. That’s what I wanted to do. I got blocked. We got what we could, but you know what? More than 20 million Americans got health insurance that didn’t have it before. Over a hundred million people had protections if they had a preexisting condition that didn’t have it before. It made things better. 
A president by himself or herself can’t eliminate all racial bias in the criminal justice system. That is a legacy that dates back a long ways. But if we elect district attorneys, and state’s attorneys, and sheriffs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. It can make sure some of the things that young people were protesting this summer don’t happen as frequently. It’s worth voting for. Voting is not about making things perfect. It’s about making things better, about putting us on a track so that, generations from now, we can look back and say, “You know what? Right then, in that election, we took a new path, and things got better.” 
That’s how so many of us enjoy the benefits of others who voted in the past. The reason we got minimum wages is because union workers were willing to work hard and sacrifice. And then, that got better for everybody. The reason women have the right to vote and to run for office is because generations back, suffrages marched and advocated until they got the right to vote. 
The reason that I’m able to stand here as a former president of the United States is because people like John Lewis were willing to brave armed batons, and horses, and dogs, and fire hoses to fight for us. The reason that this is a country that has embraced and accepted immigrants is because there were others in the past who were willing to make this journey to America, believing that, you know what? We’re going to leave behind the old undemocratic order, the old injustices. We’re going to try to make a new life here for our children and our grandchildren. They didn’t think it was going to be perfect when they got here. Folks who left Cuba, or Haiti, or Guatemala, or the folks before that, who came from Eastern Europe, they did not expect that suddenly, everything was going to be all set. But they were willing to take the risk, and make the effort, and put in the sacrifice. So, if you haven’t voted, if you haven’t voted, just think about that. Compared to what our parents and our [inaudible 00:32:58], great grandparents had to do, this is such a small thing. 
… had to do, this is such a small thing. Typically, in most elections, a little bit over half of us vote who are eligible. Think about that, close to half of the people who have the right to vote don’t vote. Imagine if 60% of us vote. Imagine if 70% of us vote. Imagine what we could do. Imagine January 20th, when we swear in a president and a vice president, who’ve got a plan to get us out of this mess, who care about working Americans, who have a plan to help you start getting ahead, who believe in science, who have a plan to protect this planet for our kids, who believe in racial equality and gender equality, and are willing to do the work to bring us closer to that point. Where, here in America, it doesn’t matter what you look like, it doesn’t matter where you come from or who you love, or how much money you’ve got, you are treated with dignity and you are treated with respect. And you can make it and chase your dreams. 
It depends on you right now. If you’re not voting, I need you to vote. 
All of that is possible. All of that is within reach if you vote. For all the times people have asked me these last four years, they said, “Boy, how have you been put up with all this?” And I confess, I said, “Look, there are times where Michelle and I were at the dinner table, we’d get discouraged. We’re just surprised when we hear the president say, “Well, they are good people on both sides,” after a Nazi march. You know, there are times where we’re discouraged by some of the outlandish statements that are made.” 
But even though we’ve seen some of our worst impulses encouraged, we’ve also seen America at its best these last four years. We’ve seen folks stand up and be heard. We’ve seen folks of every age and background pack city centers and town squares so that families wouldn’t be separated. We’ve seen the Parkland kids lead us so that another classroom wouldn’t get shot up. So this would be a moment when we finally acheive common sense gun safety laws. Were we see healthcare workers like Grace risk their lives day in day out to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people contribute and volunteer, help out their neighbors, look after that elderly person that maybe doesn’t have somebody looking after them, bringing them groceries, helping them out. We’ve seen Americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice and brutality that Black Lives Matter, no more, but no less. Just like Hispanic lives matter, no more, no less. Everybody’s worthy of respect and dignity and fair treatment. And we don’t want any child in this country to feel the continuing sting of racism. We’ve seen it here in Miami, in South Florida, we’ve seen it all across the country. 
America is a good and decent place. But we’ve seen so much noise and nonsense and misinformation. Sometimes it’s hard for us to remember that. Sometimes some of us get confused. Some of us have friends who they’re looking at their Twitter feed or they’re watching certain programs on TV and they’re good people, they just, they’ve gotten wrong information. 
But the truth is we can do better than we’re doing. We are better than what’s been reflected these last four years in our politics. And I’m asking you to remember what this country can be. I’m asking you to believe in Joe’s ability to lead this country of the dark times and help us build back better. I’m asking you not to abandoned the Americans who are hurting right now. I’m asking you not to let down the young people who are out there marching because they believed what we had taught our children about justice, help them channel their activism into action. We can’t just imagine a better future, we’ve got to fight for it. We got to out hustle the other side. We’ve got to vote for it. 
The president’s declared that he’s basically planned to announce victory no matter what the numbers are. Well, you know what? If we beat him soundly, he won’t be able to do it. But that requires everybody turning out to vote. That requires folks right here in South Florida to vote. If you are eligible to vote and you believe the country can do better, I need you to cast your ballots. Make a plan. 
Tomorrow we can choose to protect healthcare for our families. Tomorrow we can build an economy that rewards working Americans. Tomorrow we can elect leaders who reflect our best instincts and not our worst. Tomorrow we can just hope over fear, and unity over division. And if we do, Florida, if we vote like our lives depend on, we will elect Joe Biden as president. We’ll elect Kamala Harris as vice president, and we will leave no doubt about who we are and what this country that we love stands for. Thank you South Florida, let’s get to work. Vote tomorrow. I love you!"
3,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-event-speech-transcript-pittsburgh-pa-november-2,"Joe Biden Campaign Event Speech Transcript Pittsburgh, PA November 2","Hello Pittsburgh. It’s good to be back. I’ll tell you what. First off, let’s honk for the outstanding band, The Funky Fly Project. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And special thanks to local and state elected officials who are here. I want to thank them a lot and I want to also thank your police department. I tell you what. They got a one heck of a motorcycle escort. 
You know, it was great seeing Franco again. I live in the other side of the state just below that town called Philadelphia, and I get in trouble because I talk about how much I like Pittsburgh and how much I like the Steelers. Now, let me tell you why. Franco and I were just in Latrobe together last month, and Franco and his teammate, a guy named Rocky Bleier, back in the day when the Rooney’s were really wonderful to me and my family. Because just a month after I was elected the United States Senate, I was 29 years old. It was December 18th. And it was a week before Christmas. I got a phone call, when I was hiring staff in Washington, saying a tractor trailer broadsided my wife and my three children Christmas shopping, and killed my wife and killed my wife and would kill my daughter. My two boys were very badly injured. 
So I hustled home as quick as I could. And I stayed with them in that hospital room because they were really in tough shape. But on the 23rd, I believe it was, I decided that I was going to go out to Kmart and get a plastic Christmas tree. You know, those kinds they have on display, because you weren’t allowed to have any Christmas paraphernalia in the hospital that could catch fire, but I could get one of those. So I went out and I was only gone, it was the only time I was gone. I was gone for about, I guess, an hour, hour and a half. 
And I came back and both my boys for the first time, they were little guys, three and four years old, almost four and five. They had smiles on their face and each of them were holding a football signed by the entire steel curtain, the Pittsburgh team. And I said, “What happened, boys?” And they was the first time they smiled. And they said, “Rocky Bleier and Franco Harris came,” because guess what happened? The Rooneys, really fine, fine people, the Rooneys decided that they were going to send Rocky and Franco to see my boys. No publicity. They didn’t do any press. Didn’t let anybody know. 
… he, they didn’t do any press, didn’t let anybody know, they spent 45 minutes with my boys, they got in the plane and went home. 
That’s who we are as a country. That’s something the President doesn’t understand, looking out for each other. The thousand acts of kindness, the decency that people used to show to one another, and still do, that he just doesn’t get. 
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh there’s one more day, one more day to show who we are once again. Tomorrow we can end the presidency that has divided this nation. Folks in Homewood know, tomorrow we can put and end to a presidency that has failed to protect the nation. Tomorrow we can put an end to a presidency that has fanned the flames of hate across this nation, pouring gasoline on every racial incident in the country. 
Millions of Americans have already voted, over almost a hundred million now. Millions more will vote tomorrow. My message is simple, the power to change this country is in your hands. And I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting, no matter how he tries. 
There was a press article last week, and it read as follows, “Never before in modern presidential history has a candidate been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to repress the vote as Trump.” Trump doesn’t want y’all voting. He don’t want Americans voting. He thinks only wealthy folks should vote. When America votes though, america will be heard. When America’s heard, the message is going to be out loud and clear: it’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home, go home. 
Look, we’re done with the chaos, we’re done with the racism, we’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility, but we got a lot of work to do folks. If I’m elected president, we’re going to act, on day one we’re going to act to get COVID under control, on day one of my presidency I’ll put in action a plan that I’ve been talking about for months, masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, a plans for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one. 
And most importantly, but he hasn’t done yet, a plan, a plan that addresses the fact that we can get everybody access to the vaccine when it comes. Folks there’s over 300 million people in America, everyone, everyone is going to get help. A plan to address the disproportionate way the virus is hitting the black community and minority communities. We’re seeing race-based disparities all across every aspect of this virus; higher infection rates, lower access to testing, a harder time, quarantine safely, lower access to quality treatment when you become infected, and tragically higher mortality rates, three times as high as the white population. One in 1000 black Americans have died from COVID so far. And by the end of this pandemic, if things continue as he’s allowing them to do until the next president takes office, there will be another 200,000 deaths projected. And that would mean one in 500 African-Americans will have died because of COVID. 
That is absolutely outrageous. That is an attack, a mass casualty for black Americans. And this President, he knew in January how bad this virus was, in January he knew it. Some of you may remember vaguely if you turned on the television at the time, I wasn’t in office but I was talking about the fact that he got intelligence briefings laying out how dangerous it was coming from China, and where it was happening. And he said, no he didn’t read his intelligence briefing in the morning. Well, that didn’t surprise me, he doesn’t read. 
But turns out he knew exactly how dangerous it was. Remember what he said to Bob Woodward, the famous journalist? He went on tape and he said to Woodward, he knew in January how dangerous it was and how many people could die, and he said nothing. He didn’t say a thing to you, me, or anybody else. He kept it secret. He hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu. He lied to the American people. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear. He kept telling us, America was coming, or maybe we should inject bleach into our veins. I mean, whatever, God, what a… anyway. 
And just Friday, this past Friday, had the gall to suggest that the American doctors and nurses, who are literally risking their lives to save lives on the front line of this crisis for nine months, that he suggested that these folks, know what he said they’re doing? He said, “Doctors are falsely inflating the deaths due to COVID because they want to make more money.” 
Now think about that, president of the United States of America. But then again, it doesn’t surprise me, he wouldn’t do anything unless he could make more money, not a joke. Everything to him is about how do you help yourself? 
Folks, look the people of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months, none more so than our doctors and our frontline healthcare workers. And it’s the President questioning their character, and their integrity, their commitment to his fellow Americans, the President questioning that? It’s a flat disgrace. And then last night Trump said, he’s going to fire Dr. Fauci. I got a better idea, let’s fire Trump, and I’ll hire Dr. Fauci. 
Look, the President has waved the white flag of surrender in this virus. I’ll never do that. He’s chief of staff said last week, “We’re not going to control this virus.” We’re not going to control the virus, the first step to beating the virus is defeating Donald Trump. 
Look folks, if we didn’t know this was happening, and somebody made a movie about this five years ago you’d think it was all crazy, but it’s real. It’s real what’s happening. Donald Trump, by the way, he keeps telling us what a great jobs president he has been, how many jobs he’s created. Well, I was just with President Obama in Detroit, in Flint, Michigan, my buddy. It was great to be with a president with real character. A President respected around the world, a President our kids could look up to. But did you know President Obama and I helped create more jobs in the last three years of our administration than Trump did the first three years of his, even before the pandemic hit? Did you know Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years who’s going to finish with his four years in office with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started as president? 
And black unemployment remains too high, too many black businesses are shuttered for good. Black-owned businesses are shutting down twice as fast as other businesses, and business communities of color have shuttered because they didn’t get the help, the money that Congress has passed. Congress passed over $2 trillion. You know the first thing what the President did? He fired the Inspector General, who’s supposed to follow where the money went. And guess what? Minority businesses, small businesses, they didn’t get the help. It went to the Mar-a-Lago crowd. Not a joke, his wealthy friends. He fired the Inspector General. 
You know, he sees the world from Park Avenue- 
He sees the world from Park Avenue. I have seen it from Scranton. I see it from where I grew up. I see it from here in Pittsburgh. Wall Street didn’t build this country, working people built this country. That’s always whose built the country, the middle class, and unions built the middle class. 
Folks, I believe we should be rewarding work not wealth in this country. Do you all realize that just as the pandemic started, the listed billionaires in America made another $300 billion? Not a joke, $300 billion they made in the middle of the pandemic. What’s going on here, folks? 
Well, I’ve got a plan, and under my plan I commit to you no one making less than $400 grand is going to see a penny in taxes raised. But for a change, the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay zero in taxes after making billions of dollars. Well, guess what? Under a Biden administration, they’re going to start paying their fair share. Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse, a steelworker pay a higher tax rate, and this is the God’s truth, a higher tax rate than the super wealthy? And by the way, why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? 
I’ve released 23 years of my tax returns. I had the dubious distinction of being listed as “the poorest man in Congress” for 36 years. And then when I got elected vice president it says, “It’s probable no man has ever assumed the office vice president with fewer assets than Joe Biden.” I assumed they weren’t speaking about intellectual assets. It could have been, but who knows? 
Well, look, here’s my point, Trump and the only taxes that we’ve been able to find out through the New York Times in the one year he has, he paid $750 in taxes. Trump keeps talking about corruption. When’s the last time he heard of a president having a secret bank account in China? Which he did, we just found out, where he payed 50 times more tax in China than he did in the United States. Every time he starts talking about corruption, I say, “Release your tax return. What in the hell are you hiding? What are you hiding?” Not one…. Anyway, I won’t get into it. 
Look, we’re going to act to protect healthcare. Trump is going to Trump, like he just jammed through a Supreme Court nomination. You know why they did? To try to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Well, if they get their way, a hundred million Americans will lose the protections for preexisting conditions, including more than 5 million people here in the United States… I mean, excuse me, here in the state of Pennsylvania, over a hundred million in the United States. Millions of black Americans will be left uninsured and denied health coverage because of pre-existing conditions. And there are more preexisting conditions in poor communities than there are in others. 
Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s a right. Look, I’ll not only restore Obamacare, I’ll build on it. You can keep your private insurance. If you like it, you can choose Medicare like public option. I’m going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, out-of-pocket spending, surprise billing. I’m going to lower prescription drugs by 60%, and that’s the truth. But by the way, how are you going to do it, Joe? Because those wealthy people are going to start paying their fair share. 
It’s not about punishing everyone, it’s about being fair. We’ll make sure that protections for people with pre-existing conditions remain. And meanwhile, Trump said, he’s publicly said if he’s reelected, he’s going to defund Social Security payments. The actuary in social security department said if he does that, that will eliminate, eliminate Medicare by 2023, after all the who people rely on Medicare. It’s not going to happen, by the way. We’re not going to let it happen, but that’s his plan. Go home and tell your grandparents and parents, we’ll protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which he won’t do. And finally, we need a vote now to deliver some racial justice in America. Look, a season of protest has broken out all across this nation. Protesting is not burning and looting and violence, that can’t be tolerated, it won’t. But those protests are a cry for justice. In the name of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace, Jr., they’re not going to soon be forgotten. They’re not going to be forgotten by me, not by us, not by this country. They’ll inspire a whole new wave of justice in America. 
When I met with Floyd’s family, he has a little daughter who survived him, she’s six years old, and I knelt down and I talked to her. I started talking to her. You know what she said? She looked at me, she said, “Mr. Vice President, Daddy is going to change the world. Daddy’s going to change the world.” 
Folks, the country is ready. The country is ready, but not with Donald Trump as president. Now he wants us to believe so much he’s done for black Americans. You might have seen the debate I had with him. I was standing next to “Abraham Lincoln”. He said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anyone done as much for the African American community as I have.” I turned to him and asked him, “Abe,” he got offended. He got offended. Look, Pittsburgh, honk if you think his commitment of having done more for the African-American community than Abraham Lincoln is true. Honk your horn. Silence. You got it, man. Pittsburgh, honk if you think it’s a bunch of malarkey, his lying. You got it. 
Look, the truth is, Donald Trump has done more harm black America than any president in modern history. This is the same man who started the Birther Movement against my buddy, Barack Obama. This is the first man, this is the man who when the first black woman running for vice president, he looks at her and he calls her a monster. Oh yeah, man. 
And remember on stage with him When I asked about the Proud Boys, that racist group of white supremacists. I said, “Would you deny them?” He turned and he said, “I’m going to tell them to stand down and stand by.” When in God’s name did you ever expect an American president to say, who refused to denounce white supremacy, doesn’t believe systemic racism is a problem and won’t even say black lives matter. Black lives matter. And we’re going to work to deliver real police and criminal reform, justice reform. We know, we know what true justice is all about. It’s not only about a criminal justice system that’s fair, but it’s about being able to build wealth, jobs, homes, families. Folks, we’re in a situation where, think about it, how many people you know are working two jobs and still being in poverty? We need a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for everybody, period. Honk if you agree with me. Honk if you agree with me and my proposal. 
For first-term homebuyers, first-time home buyers, I promise you are going to get a $15,000 down payment for the first home. Honk. 
Honk for new capital to start businesses, because black entrepreneurs are equally successful as any other entrepreneurs, but they can’t get access. That’s why Barack and I started a program to give $1.5 billion to local small business associations to lend money. That brought 30 billion off the sideline. Well, I’ve changed that to $15 billion, and we’re going to bring 150 off the sideline. 
Look, in addition to that, think about this. Education. Education is the key to movement. Well, guess what? There’s going to be free college education for state universities when I’m your president. I’m going to triple funding. And by the way, we can afford this, I promise you. I’m going to triple funding for Title I schools so a child can get a good public education, no matter what their zip code is. Allowing every three and four and five year olds to go to school, not daycare. That increases by 58% the prospects that child will go all the way through 12 years. And honk if you agree with me. I’m going to invest $70 billion in HBCUs at minority serving institutions. For real. [inaudible 00:28:35] institutions so future generations of black students can continue to get the very best education. 
Folks, Pennsylvania, 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in Barack and me. Now in 2020, I’m asking for your trust again in me and Kamala. By the way, she is one smart, bright, tough woman, man. I’m so proud. She said yes. Look, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. That’s the job of a president, the duty to represent everyone, everyone. And you too have a duty. If you haven’t already voted, to vote tomorrow. Make a plan, get out to vote. Go to iowavote.com/pa and ask yourself if Donald Trump is so proud of his record, especially for African Americans, why does he make it so hard for us to vote? 
And then remember the final words of my good friend and American hero, John Lewis, who recently died. He said “The vote is the most powerful non-violent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it, because if not, it’s guaranteed you’ll lose it.” 
Folks, please, please. Here’s the amazing thing. Here’s the amazing thing, folks. It’s about this moment in history. On the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threats about who we are and what we believe that we’ve seen in our lifetimes. But on the other hand, our future has never been more promising. I said it many times. I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than I was when I got elected as a 29 year old kid. And I mean it. Here’s why. We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Our workers are three times as productive as workers in the biggest economies in the world. We have the strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs. We’re virtually energy independent. 
(silence) We can do this. We’re better than we’ve been. We can be our best when we’re the United States of America. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Go vote. We can get this done, I promise you."
4,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-beaver-county-pennsylvania-november-2,"Joe Biden Campaign Speech Beaver County, Pennsylvania November 2","You all must be crazy. As my mother from Scranton said, God love you. Thanks for being here. The one thing I’ve always been able to count on my whole career, unions. I know how to say union. I’m working for those unions. Hey folks, it’s good to be back in Beaver County. The fact is that we’ve been in a situation for a while here that… and Greg, thanks for the introduction, I do appreciate it. 
One of the things about the iron workers is that I think you’re all crazy. You know what I mean? I remember iron workers endorsed me early on when I first ran for the Senate as a kid. A guy name Tommy [Shrank 00:00:47], and I used to walk in the union all the time and say anybody who’s crazy enough to walk up 16 stories on beam and shoot a rivet has to be nuts. But thank God you are. Where I grew up, you either joined a trade, you became a cop, you became a firefighter or a priest. I wasn’t competent at being any one of them, so look what happened to me. 
Folks look, Conner thank you for being here and thank you for all you’ve done. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about more than just an election this time out. There’s an awful lot at stake, and of course you’re going to send Conner back. That’s all right, I’m used to babies. Babies are allowed to cry, and anybody’s allowed to cry if they want. Anybody’s allowed to make noise too. Oh, well, look, I wanted to come by to say thank you personally. Thank you very, very much for what you’ve done. As the Mayor’s here, they tell me… I don’t know where the Mayor is. Where’s the Mayor? There you are, hey Mr. Mayor, thank you pal. Being Mayor’s a real job. They know where you live and Terry and Rob I want to thank you and everybody all over Beaver County. 
Folks, look, the fact is that from the very beginning of my career, I found myself in a situation where I’ve relied on labor. And I hope I’m demonstrated that labor can rely on me. We’re in a home stretch now. We’re in a home stretch and as my coach used to say in high and college, “It’s go time. It’s go time.” Tomorrow’s the day. Tomorrow we’re going to send Conner back to Congress. We’re going to hear what labor has to say. We’re going to win Pennsylvania and we’re going to show the world what America stands for. 
Folks, as I said, I wanted to come by and thank you personally for canvassing. And thank the Mayor and everyone else that I just mentioned to you. The fact is that there’s a lot at stake in this election. We are really at one of those inflection points. This is going to be more than just who governs the next four years. What happens now, what happens tomorrow is going to determine what this country looks like for a couple generations. And that’s not a joke. I really generally believe that. 
There’s so damn much at stake. And as we get this home stretch, you find yourself going home. At least I found myself going home. This is like home. I’m from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I grew up in Claymont, Delaware. And it used to be a steel town that had steel workers, used to have 5,800 steel workers in the town. All gone, all gone now. We got to get it back. We’re not going to get it back in Claymont, but we can get it back here in the United States. 
And folks, the fact is that as I said we’re heading to a home stretch. We know the stakes have never been higher. We know they’ve never been higher. My dad used to have an expression. He’d say, “Joey,” he lost a job in Scranton when coal died when I was a kid. And we moved on to Claymont, Delaware. He took us home to my grand pops house. And he made what I call the longest walk a mom or dad has to make. Up a short flight of stairs to the kids bedrooms to say, “Honey, I’m sorry. You can’t go back to that school. You can’t play in that Little League club anymore. Dad lost his job. We’re going to have to move. We can’t stay where we are.” And he made that walk, took us over to my grand pop’s house in Scranton and what happened was he said, “I’m going down to Delaware. There’s jobs down there. I’ll come home every weekend. It’ll probably take me a year to get one. I can bring everybody down.” And so that’s exactly what happened. 
From that point on, when my dad would talk about a job, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be okay.” Not many people are saying that these days. Too many people are worried. 
I’ve never forgotten growing up in a hard working family in Scranton. The lesson that Donald Trump has never learned, because he can only see the world from Park Avenue. He can’t see what families like yours and mine have gone through. So he refuses to do the work to get this virus under control. He refuses to do the work to get our schools and our small businesses the resources they needed to stay open. Firefighters, teachers, cops, a whole lot of hard working folks. Refused to bring Congress together. They passed the money, but he refused to bring them together to provide for their families, the working families. Because he thinks Wall Street built this country. Well I got news for him, you already know it, Wall Street didn’t build America, middle class did and unions built the middle class. Unions built the middle class. That’s a fact. That is a natural fact. 
Look, I see the world from Scranton. I see this world from working class towns all around this state. And that’s why I build back better plan that I’m going to do is for the first time in a long time, we’re going to start rewarding work, not wealth. We’re not going to raise taxes for anybody making less than $400,000 bucks a year. If you make more than that, guess what? You’re going to start paying your fair share. You’re going to start stepping up. 
I’m going to ask the big corporations, the wealthy, to step up. 90 of the Fortune 500 companies, trying to railroad you guys, 90 of them, didn’t pay a penny in taxes. We’re going to invest the money that we collect of working people, creating millions of good paying union jobs. Two trillion dollars to build a more resilient infrastructure, roads, bridges, water systems. A whole lot more. Done by certified labor. And by the way, no matter how many times Trump tries to lie about it, I will not ban fracking. I never said I would. 
But I’m going to end Trumps incentives, to send jobs overseas. We have a trade strategy right now where you get 10% cut in your tax if you send a job overseas. We’re going to reverse it. You bring a job home, you get 10% and I want to promise you one thing, the president has control of $600 billion, handing out contracts for construction. For everything from building aircraft carriers, to public housing. Well here’s the promise I’m making to you, not one single contract will be let to a contractor who doesn’t have products that are all made in America. That’s a guarantee. Every one. 
We’re allowed to do that now, but we’ve never done it. It’s about time we stepped up and made sure people… by the way, one other thing I want to mention here. Donald Trump talks about himself as a tough guy. I grew up with guys like him around in Scranton. They thought because they had more money than us they could look down their nose at us. They thought that because they came from well known families, they somehow were better. Well let me tell you something, he talks about how tough he is, how hard working he is, how he’s done so much. Let me tell the things that bothered me most in this campaign and I have to tell you, the way he talked about our veterans as being losers, losers? What’s this guy all about? Who is he? He doesn’t understand what’s going on. 
Folks, my son was the Attorney General of Delaware. He gave up his seat to go fight in Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, [inaudible 00:09:02] service medal. And he came home and he died of cancer, but he came home and guess what? He was no loser. Trump’s a loser. And all of you who served. All of you who have served. I really mean it. Think about it, think about it. Is there any wonder why… this is the first president that I’m aware of. The six top Generals to work for him, six, four star Admirals and Generals, they all left to say he wasn’t worthy of being Commander in Chief. They quit. 
McRaven, [inaudible 00:09:44] Special Forces. There are the guys who did a lot commanding. They both endorsed me and they came along, 22 Four Stars stepped up and endorsed me because they knew I’d have their back as Commander in Chief. This guy doesn’t get it. 
I really mean it, many of you served. Took physical courage to do it. He doesn’t get it. Folks, we owe the military. One percent of the Americans, are protecting the other 99% of us. We owe them big. 
Look, we can only get this done though, we can only get this done in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvanians vote. We got to make sure everybody returns their ballot or votes tomorrow. Make sure everyone, everyone you know does the same. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle class, and this time bring everybody along. Everybody. It’s time to unite this country. There’s an amazing thing about this moment on history; on the one hand we’re facing the biggest threat to who we are, what we believe in our lifetimes, but on the other hand our future has never been more promising. 
I’ve said it many times, I’m more optimistic about America’s future today, than when I got elected as a 29 year old kid to the Senate. Here’s why: we’re in a better position than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Our workers are three times productive as workers around the world. We have the biggest economy in the world. The strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs. We’re virtually energy independent and we have more great research universities than the rest of the world combined. 
No other nation can touch us. No other nation can lead us. We can lead by the power of our example, not just the example of our power. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, and that’s exactly what Donald Trump’s been trying to do from the very beginning. Divide America. Pitting American’s against one another. Rural versus urban. Based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, our religion. That’s wrong. That’s not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. But we’re about honor, integrity, dignity. This is the United States of America. We’ve got to let them show who we are. We choose, we choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction, and yeah we choose truth over lies, constant lies. 
[inaudible 00:13:03]. It’s time to stand up, take back this democracy. We can do this. We’re so much better than we’ve been. We can be [inaudible 00:13:23]… you have ever seen, I guarantee you a seat at the table. God love you all, and thank you, thank you, thank you. Let’s get this vote out. May God protect our troops. Thank you. 
I want to do something that I feel very proud about. The son I told you about who I lost, I want his two children to come up here with me. Come here. This is Natalie, don’t be silly."
5,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/barack-obama-drive-in-rally-speech-transcript-atlanta-ga-november-2,"Barack Obama Drive-in Rally Speech for Joe Biden Transcript Atlanta, GA November 2","Hello, Atlanta. Hello, Georgia. Can everybody please give [Temple 00:00:19] a big round of applause? That’s the kind of young people that are going to lead the way. Oh, I am excited. Thank you for arranging for good weather. It is good to be back. I’ve got one word for you, Atlanta: Tomorrow. Tomorrow. After four years of failure, you have the power to change America. Tomorrow, you can put an end to the politics that tries to divide a nation just to win an election, that tries to stoke conspiracy theories and fear at a time when we need competence and we need hope. Tomorrow is the most important election of our lifetimes, and you can deliver the change that we need. 
Well, you’re going to have to vote. If you haven’t dropped off your ballot yet, please do not wait any longer. If you voted already, help your friends and family find their polling places at iwillvote.com. Help them make a plan to vote tomorrow because this election is going to take every single one of us. Right here in Georgia, you’ve got an even bigger power to deliver the change that we need. You can be a state that sends Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. 
I got a chance to campaign with Joe over the weekend. It felt like the old days. For eight years, he was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president, and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country. He and Kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves, but for every single one of us, but if they are going to deliver the change we need getting this pandemic under control, restarting our economy, protecting our healthcare, protecting our planet, reforming our criminal justice system, giving every young person a equal chance, then they’re also going to need a Senate that actually cares about those things. 
Georgia, not only can you put Joe and Kamala over the top, but you can be the state that gives us all a better chance because you’ve also said, “Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock to the United States Senate.” I didn’t originally plan to come to Georgia. You see all this gray hair I got? 
It still looks good, you said? All right. I’ll let Michelle know. But the reason I’m here, look, I thought after my last campaign in 2012, I thought, “All right, I’ll campaign in ’16, and then I’ll just go off and write my book and work on my golf game and spend a little more time with my wife.” Things didn’t work out the way we expected because we weren’t focused. Each one of us didn’t do everything we needed to do, and so in this election, when I got a call and said, “Look, Georgia, Georgia could be the state, Georgia could be the place where we put this country back on track, and not just because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have a chance to win Georgia, but you got the chance to flip two Senate seats?” I said, “Well, I got to go. I got to come.” I told Michelle, “I’m sorry, babe. I got to go to Georgia. This is a big deal.” 
You have two extraordinary candidates and Jon and the Reverend who deserve your vote. Let’s face it. You’ve also got two senators who badly need to be replaced. Look, I served in the Senate. I remember when we used to get briefings in the Senate for threats, including the kinds of briefings that your two current senators got about COVID-19. They got briefed. You go into this room, and it’s all top secret, and you got to close everything off and you can’t take anything out of the briefing room because this is part of your responsibility as a public servant. The point of these briefings is so that you can take quick action to protect the American people before it’s too late. That’s why the Senate gets these special briefings, to serve the interests of the people who have sent you to Washington, to serve their interests before your own. 
When I heard that your two senators here in Georgia… Understand what I’m about to say now is not a partisan statement. I’d be just as hard if I heard the Democrat was doing this. Your two senators publicly were telling you that the virus would be no big deal, but behind closed doors, they were making a bunch of moves in the stock market to try to make sure their portfolios were protected instead of making sure you are protected. Man, that’s shady. 
I mean, that ain’t right. They downplayed the pandemic in public and in private. They’re trying to see if they can profit from it. Both of them. Not just one of them. Both of them. They’re like Batman and Robin gone bad. It’s like the dynamic duo of doing wrong. I don’t know what they were thinking, but Georgia, I promise you, Georgia was definitely not on their mind. It was not. 
What’s the result of betraying the public’s trust? 230,000 Americans are dead. More than a hundred thousand small businesses have closed. Almost 200,000 jobs are gone in Georgia alone. If President Trump and your senators had been focused on COVID from the beginning instead of their portfolios or their TV ratings, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country. Just this week, nine months into the pandemic, America just had the single worst week of new cases. Think about that. 
All the people who voluntarily quarantined, all the folks who’ve been working at home, all the mothers and fathers who’ve been looking after their children at home trying to keep everybody safe, and after all that, we saw the worst week because we had people like your two senators who were not taking it seriously. We had a president who was pretending it was just like a bad flu. Now Trump’s chief of staff finally admits what we’ve known all along. He was quoted. Just a few days ago. He said, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” 
Well, yeah, we noticed. You definitely are not, but you know what? Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can get on top of this pandemic. If we got two new senators from Georgia, we can have a government that’s making that happen. What’s Trump’s closing argument right now? Last night on his COVID spreader tour… He’s going around spreading COVID. He’s like a carrier because he cares more about having big crowds than he does about keeping people safe. He told his supporters- 
… say. He told his supporters, “Don’t tell anybody, but he’s going to fire Dr. Fauci after the election.” Don’t boo. Vote. We had signs up a couple of days ago, it was Halloween, had a ghost on there, said, “Don’t boo. Vote.” Come on. 
So just in case you were worried that Trump had been taking COVID too seriously, he’s stated publicly he’s going to fire the one person in the administration, a carry over, was also the president when I was in there, helped me deal with Ebola and H1N1, was one of the people who was at the front lines of dealing with HIV AIDS, one of the world’s leading experts on infectious disease, one of the few people in this administration who has been taking the seriously all along. And what did he say? His second term plan is to fire that guy. 
I mean, they’ve already said they’re not going to contain the pandemic. Now they want to fire the one person who could actually help them contain the pandemic. So Georgia, if you think they’ve done a bad job at managing COVID so far, basically what they’re telling you now is you ain’t seen nothing yet. Trump’s saying, in this election, he’s been saying he might declare victory before all the votes have been counted. Well, that’s just what he did on this virus. And how’d that turn out? Listen, America deserves better than this. Georgia, you deserve better than this. You really do. And here’s the good news. Tomorrow, you can choose something better. Tomorrow, you can send Jon Ossoff and Reverend Warnock to the United States Senate. And they can team up with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and get on top of this crisis. Yes, we can. 
Let me, just in case you’re unfamiliar with the track record of the two outstanding candidates for Senate that you’ve heard from. Jon Ossoff’s life has prepared him to serve as your Senator. He learned about public service from my dear friend, one of my lifelong heroes, John Lewis. He’s dedicated his career to fighting injustice. He knows we need a new Voting Rights Act that makes sure every Georgian is treated equally under the law, that makes sure every Georgian can exercise the right to vote that people like John Lewis bled for. Jon Ossoff runs a company that investigates crime and corruption around the world, which sounds like something we could use in Washington right now. That’s like kryptonite to Donald Trump and those corporate lobbyists that he’s all put in his cabinet. It’s like water on the Wicked Witch. You remember. 
Jon’s wife, Alisha, is a doctor. She delivers babies. And like so many doctors who’ve been risking their lives to save others, so many nurses and healthcare workers on the front lines, Alisha has been putting herself at risk. So you know that Jon’s not going to go around accusing doctors of trying to profit from the pandemic. You heard that’s what Trump said, right? He said, “Well, doctors are exaggerating this because they just want to make more money.” These doctors, these nurses, these healthcare workers, they are in there, they are exposing themselves to this disease. They are more at risk than anybody. And Jon Ossoff understands that because he’s seeing it in his own family. He’s going to listen to the experts and work with Joe Biden to get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing and vaccines free for every American and make sure our frontline heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment they need because it’s going to be here, right there ready for American workers. 
And you know the other thing Jon’s going to do is he’s going to protect your healthcare. There have been more than nine million cases of COVID-19 in America. And even for folks who get better, your insurer could still consider COVID-19 a pre-existing condition, which means you might not be able to get insurance next time if the protections that we put in place 10 years ago with the Affordable Care Act were eliminated. Republicans love to say right before an election they’re going to protect your preexisting conditions. Listen, with the Affordable Care Act, Joe Biden and I actually did it 10 years ago. Those protections are already in place. We were acquired insurers to cover your pre-existing conditions. And since then, Republicans have tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 60 times. They’ve promised, “Don’t worry. After we repeal it, we’re going to replace it with a really wonderful plan.” Every two weeks for 10 years they’ve been promising a new plan. Have you seen this new plan? I haven’t either. Nobody’s seen it. You know why? Because they don’t have a new plan. 
They’ve just attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, and in the process, driven up costs, driven up the uninsured. Now they’re in the Supreme Court trying to get the Supreme Court to take your healthcare away in the middle of a pandemic. Why would you do that? Just to spite me? Why in the middle of a pandemic would you offer nothing but empty promises and try to kick people off their healthcare? 
Georgia, something got to go. It’s either your senators or your healthcare. If I were you, I’d choose your healthcare. Get rid of the senators who are trying to take it away. You know your senators aren’t going to stand up to protect it. They love to talk tough like President Trump. But one of the things they have in common with them is when you start calling them out, they cut and run. You saw president Trump. He’s in the middle of a 60 Minutes interview. He just walked out. It’s too tough. He quit in the middle of an interview. Somebody is asking them, “Well, what are you going to do in your second term?” “That’s too tough. I’m leaving.” And then you saw it again last week when Jon Ossoff called out Senator Perdue on healthcare in their debate. Perdue was like one of those chickens. I would have felt bad for the guy if he hadn’t voted four times to take away your pre-existing conditions protections. Four times he voted against it. They were supposed to have another debate last night. Perdue chickened out, pulled out. The scariest Halloween costume he saw this year was Jon Ossoff in debate. 
But let me tell you what’s really scary, Georgia. Republicans threatening to end preexisting conditions protections for 100 million people in the middle of a pandemic. That is scary. And you have the power to do something about it. Jon Ossoff and Joe Biden will protect your healthcare. They will expand Medicare. They will make insurance more affordable for everyone. 
And so will Reverend Raphael Warnock. Let me talk about the good Reverend right now. I won’t preach, but I will offer testimony. This is a man who preaches at Ebeneezer Baptist Church in the pulpit of its great pastor, Dr. King. He’s read the gospels and they might not have known about pre-existing conditions back then, but the Reverend will tell you Jesus spent time healing the sick, caring for the poor. When Georgia Republicans fought against expanding Medicaid to cover hundreds of thousands of your fellow Georgians, Reverend Warnock followed the example of John Lewis and got himself arrested getting into good trouble. Reverend Warnock’s life prepared him to live in service to others. He doesn’t just talk the talk. He walks the walk. Here’s a man who grew up in public housing in Savannah with 11 brothers and sisters. That’s a lot of brothers and sisters- 
… in Savannah with 11 brothers and sisters. That’s a lot of brothers and sisters. That taught him a little bit about working together, by looking out for others, about sharing. His mom spent her summers as a young woman, picking cotton and tobacco. His dad was a veteran and a small businessman who preached on Sunday. He knows about the power of opportunity and the God-given right to dignity and decent wages for working people. Reverend Warnock earned his degree at Morehouse, a Morehouse man, but he did it with the help of Pell Grants and student loans, so, you know, he’s going to fight for every single young person who dreams of a college education, but doesn’t know how he or she’s going to pay for next semester’s classes. 
He’s been there. Last time I saw Reverend in person, was in Ebeneezer Baptist church for the Memorial service for John Lewis. He possesses the moral courage John did, to question right, and wrong and call things for what they are. He’s got the moral clarity to shine a spotlight on injustice and make the powers that be, uncomfortable. We need some folks who will shake things up a little bit, and he’s going to lead us in Washington to overcome our own complacency and our own fears and our own prejudices, to become better truer versions of ourselves. That’s who he is, and that’s who we all need to be. 
Look, we got one day left. I’ve been making a lot of arguments out there. Some of them should be obvious, and yet I know that there’s still people out there who aren’t voting. I want to talk to you right now. The people of Georgia right now, who decided not to vote. Maybe you don’t like who’s in the White House right now, but you just lost faith in government. You’re frustrated. You don’t think government makes a difference. Maybe you’re troubled by what the two current senators in Georgia have done, but you’re not really confident or certain about how much of a difference it’ll make in your lives. I understand that. The government’s not perfect. Government doesn’t solve every problem. 
We’ve got a long legacy in this country, of hardship and prejudice and people who are powerful and rich, taking advantage of folks who aren’t. We have a history right here in Georgia, that John Lewis fought and other fought, and sometimes I can get down. Michelle can get down. Sometimes we’re at dinner table. We’re just like, “Lord, why are we still fighting some of these battles? I thought we settled some of these arguments. I thought we had turned the corner. Why are we still hearing people praise folks who think that the color of your skin determines your status? Why are we still acting as if women shouldn’t be treated the same as men, and paid the same for doing the same work? Why are we having these old arguments? I thought these were done.” 
It can be discouraging sometimes. You drive through some neighborhoods in Atlanta or Chicago or Washington DC, or you go out in some rural areas and some small towns, and you think, “You know what? Folks are still having a hard time, and some of the things that should have been fixed, haven’t been fixed,” and you get discouraged. I get it. Even as President of the United States, there were times where I thought, “Man, I want … I thought I could get this done or that done, and somehow the special interests and the lobbyists and others are blocking it and making it hard.” 
You get frustrated. I get it. But you know what? Whenever I get in one of those moods, I just remind myself that when we work together, when we put in a little bit of effort, things may not get perfect, but they do get better. When John Lewis started marching across that bridge, it didn’t eliminate racism and bigotry in America, but it started something that got the Voting Rights Act passed. It made things better. I didn’t get everything done that I want to get done when I was president. But I could say, when I looked back at the end eight years, you know what? The country is better off now than it was when I took office. 
20-some million million people have healthcare that didn’t have it before. That’s a good thing. Children that were in poverty had been lifted up out of poverty, not all of them, but some of them. That’s a good thing. Maybe this next generation came up and saw that black and white can work together, that we don’t have to be at odds, that we can treat each other with dignity and respect, that we don’t have to be scared of each other, but should reach out to each other. A president by himself, can’t solve every challenge in the economy. But if we elect people like Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, if we elect Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who are focused on working people and getting you the help that you need, it can make a difference for thousands of people and 10 thousands of people, maybe a few million people might be better off. 
A president, by himself, can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But, if we elect district attorneys and state’s attorneys and sheriffs who are focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. John understood this. Dr. King understood this. Abraham Lincoln understood it. George Washington understood it. John, I remember talking to John Lewis right before he passed. We talked about all these young people who had come out to start this wave of marches, non-violent, peaceful protests all across the country. We talked about how this younger generation, they don’t have to choose between protest and politics. If we’re going to translate our aspirations into laws and practices, we’ve got to engage in both. 
There’s nothing un-American about protest. This country was founded on protesting against injustice. That’s what the American Revolution was about. John ran for office all those years, and kept protesting even while he was in office, because he understood they’re two sides of the same coin. It’s us acting on behalf of our highest aspirations, even though we know we won’t get there. We’re never going to get all the way to the Promised Land, but we can help lay the path for future generations to get there. That’s what public service should be about. That’s what citizenship should be about. 
That’s what voting is about. Not making things perfect, but making things better, laying that path, brick by brick, to a better future, putting us on track, so that a generation from now, two generations from now, three generations from now, we can look back and we can say, “Yeah, that was a moment when we turned towards our better angels, towards our better impulses, where we started to pull together as a nation, instead of being riven apart.” The fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want, is not a good reason not to vote. We got to keep at it. 
Typically, just over 50% of us vote. Think about that. Almost half the people who are eligible, typically, do not vote. Yes, part of this is because folks make it hard to vote. Your governor right here in Georgia, seems to make it his job to come up with ways to make it as hard as possible for some Georgians to vote. I- 
These folks sure are scared of folks voting, aren’t they? Think about that. If you’ve decided you don’t want to vote. Don’t you wonder why it is that the folks in power are so worried about you voting? There must be a reason why they’re trying to make it hard for you to vote, it’s because they know if you vote, things change, the answer is not to stay home, it’s to turn out like never before and show them what’s in your heart. Show them the spirit of community. Imagine if 60% of us voted. Imagine if 70% of us voted, not a hundred percent, just 70%. 
Imagine January 20th. When we swear in President Biden and Vice President Harris and Reverend Warnock and John Ossoff are in the United States Senate. Imagine having leaders in office who have a plan to get us out of this mess and who care about working Americans and have a plan to help you start getting ahead, who believe in science and have a plan to protect this planet for our kids, who believe in racial equality and are willing to do the work to bring us closer to an America where no matter what you look like, or where you come from, or who you love, or how much money you got, everybody’s treated with dignity. Everybody’s treated with respect. Everybody, if they’re willing to work hard, has a chance to make it. Imagine having public officials who you abide by the values our mamas and our grandmas and grandpas taught us. 
Being honest, being responsible, working hard, looking after those who can’t look after themselves, showing compassion, believing in justice. All that is possible. All that is within our reach for all. And the reason I know it is, is because I’ve seen it all across the country. Every time I’ve gotten discouraged over these last four years, whenever I’ve seen our worst impulses revealed, I’ve also seen America at its best. I’ve seen folks of every age and background look out for other people, packing cities and town squares so that families wouldn’t be separated, rallying so that another classroom won’t get shot up, proclaiming that we need to do something to make sure our kids won’t grow up in an uninhabitable planet. We have seen healthcare workers risk their lives daily to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people contribute and volunteer, bring food to neighbors, help out the elderly who are alone, who are having an especially hard time. 
WRight now we’ve seen Americans of all races join together to declare in the face of injustice and brutality that black lives matter no more, but no less. That we don’t want anybody feeling superior or better than anybody else. We just want everybody to treat each other with common decency and respect. That’s all we want, just basic fairness so that no child in this country should feel the continuing sting of racism and that they’re judged by the content of their character. We’ve seen people march all across this country. You’ve seen towns where they’re barely any black folks and they still got folks marching with signs up because they believe that we can be better. Georgia, America’s a good and decent place. 
We’ve just seen so much noise and so much nonsense and distraction. And we’ve seen media companies and politicians make a business of making us hate each other because it drives clicks and drives eyeballs. And so sometimes it’s hard to remember, but I’m asking you to remember what this country can be. Georgia is a better place than it used to be. There used to be a lot of violence and cruelty in this place. And it’s a better place because some folks went out there and made sacrifices, black and white. In America, it’s a better place than it used to be, but it can be better now, but you’ve got to do the work. It’s all up to you now. I’m asking you in your ability to believe in John Ossoff and Reverend Warnock and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, but most importantly, your collective ability to get us out of these dark times and help us build back better. 
I’m asking you to believe in your ability to change America. We can’t abandon the Americans who are hurting right now. We can’t abandon the young people who aren’t getting the education they deserve right now. We can’t abandon those young people who are out there who inspired us this summer. We’ve got to channel their activism in action. We can’t just imagine a better future. We’ve got to fight for it. If you haven’t voted yet, go out and vote. It’s not that much to ask, go out there and vote, do this basic thing that can make America better. Tomorrow we can choose to protect healthcare for our families. Tomorrow we can rebuild an economy that rewards working Americans and not just the wealthy of us. Tomorrow we can elect leaders who reflect our best instincts and not our worst. Tomorrow we can choose hope over fear and unity over division. 
The promise to change over the power of the status quo. And if we do, Georgia, we vote like our lives depend on it because they do, we will let John Ossoff and Reverend Warnock to the United States Senate, we will send Joe Biden, Kamala Harris to the White House, and we will leave no doubt about who we are and what this country stands for. Honk if you’re ready to go. Honk if you’re fired up. Georgia, let’s do this. Let’s go out there and show that we believe. God bless you. God bless the United States of America."
6,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-event-speech-transcript-pennsylvania-november-2,Kamala Harris Campaign Event Speech Transcript Pennsylvania November 2,"Hi. Hi. Hi, Pittston. Hi, guys. Hi. We’re going to get this done, aren’t we? 
Oh, it’s so good to be with everyone and be back. And my dear friend, Bob Casey, and the Casey family, and there they are. And [Mammo 00:00:25], thank you for that introduction. And it is good to be in the house of labor. 
It’s so good to be with you guys. I was talking to Joe, we’re very excited about our day in Pennsylvania. Joe is going to be here. Jill’s going to be here. Doug and I are here. Well, Doug and I were together this morning, and then we parted to go our separate ways within the state. And then, we’re going to all end up, Joe and Jill will be in Pittsburgh tonight, and Doug and I are going to be in Philly tonight. And it’s just so good to be here. 
You guys have been laying the ground for, dare I say, years and certainly months, weeks, and days. And here we are, can you imagine? The day before the election that is going to decide the future of our country for generations. For generations. And I mean, I don’t need to tell you guys what’s at stake. We know what’s at stake. And I mean, we’re all here because we know that we’re better, so much better, than the guy who’s currently in the White House. 
And on this eve of the election, I just actually want to talk about Joe. I’m not going to talk about the other guy. 
I don’t feel like talking about him right now. I just don’t. I’m going to talk about Joe. So let’s talk about Joe and the Joe we know, right? I mean, listen, when we think about the challenges that we’re facing as a country, and Joe talks about this all the time, he talks in particular about the four crises that are front and center and have converged. 
There’s obviously the pandemic. Now, let’s think about this. It is a public health crisis of a proportion that we have never seen. I say it’s a mass casualty event that probably is equal or greater to what we experienced in World War II. People are suffering. Over 225,000 people have died in just the last several months, and so many without their family, because of the nature of this, to just hold their hand in their last days. And for any of us who have had that awful experience, to not be with your family member to tell them you love them in those last moments, it’s awful. Over 9 million people have contracted the virus. Many doctors are saying they’re going to have long-term consequences, lung scarring, things like that. 
And here’s the thing about Joe in a moment like this, first of all, Joe, without having had the benefit of the inside information, like you know who, and we know what you know who knew because Bob Woodward told us, Joe, back in March, because he had an experience with Ebola, because Joe has been a leader and a dedicated public servant his entire career, because Joe is a student of issues and history, Joe, back in March, told us what we needed to do about this pandemic. And he’s not even in elected office when he said it. 
Joe knew the importance, and you all know because you know his story, Pennsylvania knows this story more than most, Joe has seen suffering. Joe has spent far too much time in a hospital with the people he loves. So Joe is somebody who borne out of awful sacrifice and commitment, together with President Obama, created one of the most significant public health policies, dare I say, public policies we’ve seen, some could argue since Social Security, when they got passed the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people that didn’t have it. 
Joe understands the significance and responsibility of our government in one of its core functions, which is to concern itself with the public health and wellbeing of the American people. And that’s why he and President Obama pushed for the Affordable Care Act. And what is Joe committed to doing? Going forward, he’s going to expand the Affordable Care Act, build on its success, expand on it, bring down premium costs, bring down drug prices, prescription drug prices. 
Joe knows when we’re talking about healthcare, look, the body doesn’t just start from the neck down, it includes the neck up. That’s called mental health care. And Joe is deeply committed to doing that work because he knows that it is just as simple as what should be necessary if we value the point that access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. 
Joe knows that access to healthcare is a matter of respecting the dignity of people and wanting that people don’t suffer, wanting that people are not in pain. When you break it down, this is so much bigger than a political issue or an ideological issue. It really is a moral issue. And that’s why Joe cares about it. 
You look at the economic crisis that we’re in right now. Joe has always been a fighter for working people his entire career. Joe and I, one of the things I love about being on this ticket with him, when we have time together and we’re sitting down talking and maybe our family members are with us, and he has a ton of stories from his uncle and his father, and he will tell them. And I’ve got my sayings from my mother, and so we just kind of, “Well, my mother said this.” “Well, my dad said that.” We go back and forth. 
But you know Joe’s background. Joe cares about working people. He comes from working people. He learned early in his life the dignity of hard work and the ethic of hard work. So Joe knows that we need to honor labor, honor organized labor, honor collective bargaining. 
Honor the fact that a hard day’s work should come with the benefit of paid sick leave, paid family leave. Joe knows those things. I love being on this ticket with Joe because he probably, and I believe, God willing, we win, we will probably have the most pro-labor administration we’ve seen in a long time. 
So on the issue of the economy, whenever Joe’s asked about the economy, his measure of the economy is to ask not about the stock market and rich people. Joe asks, “Well, how are working people doing? How are working families doing?” Which is why we’re committed to making sure that taxes don’t get raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We’re committed to saying working families should not have to pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. We’re committed to saying that if a student comes from a family that makes less than $125,000, they will go to a four-year public college for free. 
That’s how Joe thinks about the economy. Joe knows that, first of all, that tax break that they gave the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America is just wrong and needs to be undone. And we will undo it. 
But we also know that the money needs to go to an investment in the people, in working people, and investment in infrastructure, and really following through on a commitment to build up our roads and our bridges, really following through on a commitment, understanding that an investment in infrastructure is an investment in the American workforce, understanding you invest in infrastructure, it’s also going to be about a partnership with the building trades, the carpenters, the plumbers, the electricians, understanding they have some of the best, best apprenticeship programs in the world. And when we talk about building up the skills of America’s workforce, that’s how you do it. Joe understands. Remember, Joe was responsible for saving the auto industry. 
Joe understands, listen, we’re not going to make a false choice or take a false choice on what we need to do to save the climate with a climate crisis, but we see an opportunity here to actually grow the economy and build jobs. And so Joe has made a commitment, we will invest in America’s auto industry so we are the number one manufacturer of electric vehicles. 
Because one of the things that you and I know about Joe is in a moment of crisis, and he has faced so many, Joe always sees a moment of opportunity. At his core, he is an optimist because he knows when you face a crisis head on, and you work hard, you can actually come through it and maybe even come through it better. 
So these are the things I think about when I think about Joe, and when I think about what’s at stake in this election… And everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. We could go through all the policies. We know that. But what’s at stake also is what we need to do to recapture who we really are as Americans. We know that the real measure of strength of any human being is not based on who you beat down, it’s based on who you lift up. 
And that’s how Joe thinks about us, that’s how he thinks about our country, and that’s how he thinks about what a real leader looks like. And we need that right now. We are so much better than what we’ve had to endure these last four years. 
So there’s a lot at stake, and we want to make sure that everybody we know votes, okay? Because I think you all know, and that’s why we’re all here and keep coming back, because we care about Pennsylvania and because Pennsylvania’s going to determine the outcome of this election. 
Right? And I love seeing our young leaders here. So we need to do our part. We need to do our part, right? Because this election truly is, as Joe says, about a battle for the soul of our nation. This is what this is. 
And so, here’s the thing, I think that, again, we know what’s at stake. We know why we should vote. We know the many people who fought for our right to vote. We know why we should vote. We know that there are a lot of folks around the country, including you know who, who have been trying to openly suppress the right to vote, to intimidate, to make it difficult, to make it confusing. 
And in fact, reporters will often ask me, they’ll say, “Well, what do you think’s going to happen? The day after the election, what do you think’s going to happen?” I said, “Look, there’s no question that over the last four years, our democracy has taken a beating. There’s no question.” If you think of it as a house, yeah, some of the shingles have fallen off, but the house is still standing. 
The house is still standing. And one of the reasons the house is still standing is because I do believe, Pittston, I do believe that when we, be it in Pittston, when it be we were in North Carolina yesterday, we were in Georgia yesterday, I was in Florida and Texas the day before, wherever you are, one of the things that we know about who we are as Americans is that this democracy that we hold dear and cherish will always be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. 
And we are prepared to do just that. So let’s get out there over the course of today and tomorrow and let’s-"

Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. And you guys can push the other something real quick, I tell you. Thank you very, very much. And Courtney, thank you for that introduction. And I want to thank Representative Marcia Fudge. We’ve been hanging out in the back here in the tent, along with [inaudible 00:06:51] out there, and Joyce is out here. Joyce Beattie, I can’t see it. Oh, there you are. Okay, I see you guys. And by the way, I want you all to meet, I got four of my grandchildren with me today. All my grandkids, stand up, stand up. 
They’re my good luck charms. They’re my heart. And Marcy and Joyce and Tim Ryan. Tim, you over there too? Hey, Tim. Tim, you’ve been so great the whole campaign. Thank you very, very, very much. And he as tough as nails. They’re all incredible leaders and we need to send them back to Congress, every single one of them. 
Folks, I want to thank my buddy, Sherrod Brown. No one fights harder for the dignity of working people than Sherrod does. Sherrod won reelection in ’18 about at the same margin that Trump did. And so when Sherrod tells me to come to Ohio the day before, I come to Ohio. That’s what I do because he and I have something in common. We married way up. He married a Pulitzer prize winner. I married a professor, and I tell you what, Connie you’ve been wonderful. Connie actually reviewed my wife’s book, I found out. 
Anyway, I want to thank you for being here. Folks, Ohio, one more day, one more day. Tomorrow. Tomorrow we have an opportunity to put an annual presidency. That’s divided this nation. Tomorrow we can put an ad to a president as has failed to protect this nation. And tomorrow we can put it down to a president who has fanned the flames of hate all across this country. Millions of Americans have already voted. Almost a hundred million have voted so far, a hundred million voted already, and more are going to vote today. And my message is simple. The power to change the country is in your hands. I don’t care how much Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing… 
No matter how much Donald Trump tries, there’s nothing, nothing he’s going to do to stop the people in this nation from voting. Folks, he hasn’t figured it out. Presidents don’t determine who gets to vote. Voters determine who’s going to be the president. When America votes, America will be heard. When America is heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear. It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. We’re done. We’re done with the chaos. We’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility. We’ve got a whole lot of work to do. 
When I’m elected your president, I’m going to act, and I’m going to act on day one. Folks, we’re going to act to get this COVID under control. On day one of my presidency, we’re going to put it in action a plan that I’ve been talking about for months, and he’s been paying no attention to. Masking, social distancing, testing, tracing. A plan for a fair and full and free distribution of therapeutics and vaccines, when we get one. Imagine, imagine where we’d be, had this president, from the beginning, just wore a mask instead of mock wearing a mask. 
I can tell you this. We wouldn’t have 9 million confirmed COVID cases in this nation, wouldn’t have over 230,000 deaths, wouldn’t be seen those new record numbers of cases we’re seeing every single day, right now. Nearly 100,000 cases in one day, just two days ago. 100,000 new cases. We wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 projected deaths in the next few months. 
This president knew, last January, the virus was deadly, but he hid it from the American people. He knew it was worse than the flu. He lied to the American people. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear, but he kept telling us a miracle was coming. And just Friday, you had the gall… Figure this, now. The president of the United States of America, who’s responsible for so many deaths, he had the gall to suggest that American doctors, the people who have been on the front lines of this crisis for nine months, along with nurses and so many others, many of whom have died, to suggest that doctors are falsely inflating deaths due to COVID because they want to make more money. 
I’m serious, man. This guy’s a disgrace. The people of this nation have suffered. They’ve sacrificed for nine months, not more than those doctors and nurses and those healthcare workers. And this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. As I said, it’s a disgrace. And last night, Trump said he was going to fire Dr. Fauci. Isn’t that wonderful? I got a better idea. Elect me, and I’m going to hire Dr. Fauci, and we’re going to fire Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump waved the white flag of surrender to this virus. He did that. His own chief of staff said, last week, we’re giving up on the virus. We’re not going to do anything about it. I’m never going to raise the white flag and surrender. We’re going to beat this virus. We’re going to get it under control, I promise you. Look, the first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great jobs president he is. I was just with Barack in Detroit and Flint. It was great to be with a president of some character, a president respected around the world, a president our kids could and did look up to. But did you know that, after President Obama and I bet on American workers and helped rescue the auto industry, nearly 500,000 jobs created here in Ohio. Meanwhile, 330,000 of those have been lost since Trump’s become president. You know, Donald Trump is going to be the first president in 90 years… that’s a lot of presidents… in 90 years, is going to finish his four years in office with fewer jobs than when he got elected to office. 
It’s no surprise. Remember the lies he told all the workers. He told the families of the GM plant in Lordstown. He said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.” But then the plant shut down. And after the first debate in Cleveland, I met an Ohio woman named Tiffany whose husband lost their job at the plant. And he had to take a job eight hours away in another state. He drives home weekends, 16 hours round trip, to be home with his kids. So much for “Don’t worry.” 
What about his threat and his grudge against Goodyear? What about his broken promise to protect pensions for workers, especially [inaudible 00:14:35] employer pensions? And what about… He stopped the overtime for millions of American workers, over $1,200,000,000 for American workers, the president and I was helping your delegation put in place. But let’s not forget how Donald Trump is wreaking chaotic with China on trade. Farm bankruptcies are way up. Exports are way down. Agricultural exports to China during the Trump years have been 40% lower than they were when we were in our second term. 
And he even says, because of his bailouts to the farmers… that’s your tax dollars, by the way… his bailout of the farmers, “Our farmers are doing better now than when they actually had a farm.” Can you believe that? Our farmers are doing better now than when they actually had a farm because they were able to be bailed out, although they may not have a farm anymore. 
Who does this guy think he is? My policies are going to hold China accountable. I’ll end the Trump tax loopholes that incentivized companies to ship jobs overseas. I’ll add a 10% surtax on companies who do ship jobs overseas. But for companies who bring and come back and invest in American manufacturing and bring jobs back home, I’ll offer a 10% tax credit. And folks, it’s no violation of any trade agreement, but no government contracts. And the president has about $600 billion in contracts from the military on down. No government contract will be given it to a company that isn’t have all the products, including the supply line, all products made in America, every product. 
Look, and our future will be made right here, right here in Ohio. Folks, we’re in a position that we can do so much more, so much more. Folks, Donald Trump forgot and betrayed Ohio workers. Quite frankly, I grew up around guys like Donald Trump. I grew up in neighborhoods like probably many of you did, working class neighborhoods where most people didn’t have a college education. But we had guys like Trump we used to play against, when we played ball and Scranton and [inaudible 00:08:07]. And because they had more money than we did, they kind of look down their nose on us. 
I got to admit to you. I got a bit of a chip on my shoulder, when I read about… Once we won the nomination and things began to look a little better, I read from serious press people… they’re decent, honorable people… that if I get elected, I’ll be the first president who didn’t have an Ivy League degree, in a long time. Well, let me tell you something. Somehow that’s got to mean I didn’t belong, because I went to a state university. But let me tell you what. It’s about time a guy from a state university graduated into the White House because, if I’m there, you’re going to be there, too. Look, Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, looking down- 
Trump sees the world from Park Avenue, looking down on Wall Street. I see it from Scranton and Claymont, where I grew up. I shaved from here in Cleveland. Wall Street didn’t build America, the middle class built America. And guess what? Unions built the middle class. That’s a fact. The day is long past time, we start rewarding work, not wealth in this country. Under my plan, if you make less than $400,000, you won’t pay a single penny, more in taxes. You have my word on it. But I tell you what, the wealthiest of MOS, big corporations, 91 of which don’t pay any tax, that paid zero federal income tax. They’re going to start paying their fair share. Why? Listen to me, why should a firefighter, an educator, a cop, why should a welder, why should a steel worker pay the higher tax rate than the super wealthy? 
It’s not right. Why should you pay for taxes than Donald Trump for God’s sake? Look, I released 22 years of my tax returns. You can look them up online. Donald Trump didn’t release any. Wonder what the hell he’s hiding. I wonder why he won’t let anybody know what his tax returns are. Who’s he owe the money to? This is the guy, by the way we found out recently has a secret bank account in China. Paid 50 times more tax in Beijing than he did in the United States. And overall, the one income tax the New York Times got, he paid $750 in federal taxes. How about you? And when he was asked how he could pay so little, remember what he said? He said, “because I’m smart. I know how to game the system.” And that’s the kind of guy you want as president? That can game the system, be a billionaire pay 750 bucks in taxes. While you all break your necks, break your necks to pay a fair share. 
We’re going to act to protect healthcare by the way. Trump and Republicans just jammed through a new Supreme Court nomination for one basic reason. Within a week after the election, they’re going to be before the Supreme Court and this new nominee is going to be out of the court. It’s all about destroying the Affordable Care Act, getting rid of it completely. They’ve been trying to do it now for nine years, if they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including nearly 5 million folks here in Ohio. Look, Donald Trump doesn’t understand healthcare. He thinks it’s a privilege. I think healthcare is a right. 
By the way, because of the way he ruined the economy, even before the pandemic, 10 million Americans have already lost their employer-based healthcare because the employer has gone out of business. Now he wants to go after the 22 million, who have healthcare only because of the Affordable Care Act. I’m not only restore the Affordable Care Act, I’ll build on it. You can keep your private insurance, or you can choose a Medicare-like public option in the new plan. I’m going to increase subsidies and lower premiums and deductibles, out of pocket expenses and surprise billings. We’re going to reduce drug costs by 60% by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices for all of us. Folks, folks, it’s going to cost more money, but guess how I’m going to pay for it? Trump’s going to start paying some taxes. 
We’re going to make sure we keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Meanwhile, the Social Security expert, the person the Social Security department says if Donald Trump’s plan that he announced, if he’s reelected, he’s going to put in place, if in fact it’s put in place, it would bankrupt Social Security by 2023. This guy really cares a lot about this, doesn’t he? He really understands, [inaudible 00:22:56] my parents before me and everyone else paying into Social Security. So go home and tell your parents and grandparents, what a great deal they’re going to get if Trump gets reelected. But folks, the fact is I’m going to protect your Social Security. I guarantee it. Because I got people behind me who’re going to make sure it’s protected. We’re going to protect Social Security, and we’re going to have a situation where guess what? We have a majority in the United States Senate. Well, folks, look, the thing that’s bothered me most, maybe emotionally bothered me the most, but substantively as well. That this president has done, there’s been nothing worse than the way he’s spoken about those who have served in uniform. He called you all losers and suckers. My son Beau was the attorney general of the state of Delaware. My son Beau volunteered. He had to give up the seat of attorney general to volunteer, to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal, and he saw the people die in Iraq. He was not a loser. He was not a sucker, he was a Patriot, just like all your sons and daughters, parents, or grandparents who served. Folks, six generals who worked in the white house with the president of United States and admirals worked in his administration have since left. And they’ve said he is unfit to be Commander in Chief. Best of my knowledge, that’s never happened before for any president of the United States. And that’s why special operations commander Stanley McChrystal, as well as the commander special ops and the Navy Seals who took out Brin Laden, along Bill McRaven, Admiral McRaven, along with 22 other four stars, they’ve endorsed me saying they’d be proud to have me as their Commander in Chief. 
This president likes to portray himself as a tough guy, a macho man. When the last time you saw a president of United States, literally being laughed at by the world leaders when he spoke to the United Nations? I don’t ever recall that ever happening. Can you believe when the president of United States, who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy, Putin put bounties on the heads of American soldiers in Afghanistan. Trump spoke to him six times and he was too frightened to challenge him. Why? Donald Trump is not strong, he’s weak. This is a president who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, he doesn’t understand courage. Physical courage it takes for so many of you to put on that uniform. We must support our military. Let’s make this vote for them as well. God love them. 
We have to vote to meet the challenge, the climate crisis as well. We can act to meet that climate crisis. Trump calls the climate crisis a hoax. I see it as a great opportunity to improve our health as well as great millions of good paying jobs. I see America’s working to build and install 500,000 charging stations all across this country. American consumers switching to clean electric vehicles. We can own the electric vehicle market, creating minutes of jobs here in Cleveland and in Ohio and in Detroit. 
Folks, I see the federal government harnessing the purchasing power by buying these electric vehicles. Made in America, made in Ohio, made in Detroit, made in America- 
Made in Ohio, made in Detroit, made in America. It’s going to mean one million, according to the experts, one million new good paying auto jobs in the automobile industry alone. Folks, if we don’t act China’s going to own the market. China’s going to own it all. And we will act, in addition to deliver racial justice in America. Folks, protesting is not burning and looting, violence must never be tolerated and it won’t, but these protests are a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will soon not be forgotten. You know I’ve met with all these families. Well I met with Floyd’s little girl, I think she was six years old. I knelt down to say, or to be at eye level with her. She looked at me and she said, I swear to God, said, “Mr. Vice President, my daddy is going to change in the world. My dad is going to change the world.” 
Folks, I’m not going to forget. You’re not going to forget. This country’s not going to forget. This is going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. But guess what? Because we have the X generation, I mean the Z generation, that in fact is the most open, least prejudice, best educated generation in American history. They’re already moving. They’re already insisting on justice. They know who we are. A new wave of justice America, but also true justice isn’t just about how they deal with police, it’s about jobs. It’s about building wealth. It’s about families. It’s about education. It’s about opportunity. It’s about being able to make a decent living. Nobody should have to work two jobs to stay out of poverty. That’s why, honk if you agree with me that a $15 minimum wage is necessary nationwide. Honk. 
Honk, if you think assistance for a down payment, for a real shot of home ownership should be coming forward with me with $15,000 for first time homeowner, to start a small business, send the child to college debt-free. Folks, Ohio in 2008, 2012, you place your trust in me and Barrack. In 2020, I’m asking you to trust me again. I’m proud of the coalition this campaign is built. To welcome Democrats, Republicans and Independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’ll govern as an American president. There will be no red States and blue States, just the United States. 
And I promise you I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a president, to care, to care about everybody, everybody. That’s the duty of a president. And look, you too, have a duty, a duty to vote. Folks, make a plan, go to Iwillvote.com/OH. Folks, the amazing thing about this moment in our history, on the one hand, we’re facing the biggest threat of who we are, what we believe, and what we seen, what we’ve been in our lifetimes. Another hand, our future has never been more promising. I’ve said it many times, the character of America is literally on the ballot. 
The character of our country, but I’m more optimistic about America’s future today than when I was elected to the United States Senate as a 29 year-old kid. Let me tell you why. We are better positioned than any nation in the world to lead the 21st century. Our workers are three times as productive as other workers. We have the biggest economy in the world. We have the strongest military in the history of the world. We have the most innovative entrepreneurs in the world and we are virtually energy independent. We have more great research universities in America than all the rest of the world combined, out of which all these doing inventions have occurred. 
No other nation can match us. We lead by the example of our power, not just by the power of our example. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has tried to do from the beginning of his campaign, divide America. The only way he can win, separate us. Pit Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. It’s wrong. It’s not who we are, but it’s his only prospect. 
Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction and yes, we choose truth over lies. Folks, it’s time to stand up. It’s time to take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re so much better than this. We can be our best, ladies and gentlemen. This is the United States of America. There’s not a damn thing we can’t do, nothing. So let’s get up and do it. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
8,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-event-speech-transcript-philadelphia-november-1,Joe Biden Campaign Event Speech Transcript Philadelphia November 1,"Hello, hello, hello. Hello, Philadelphia. It’s great to these everyone. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I want to thank Bishop Reid. I really mean it. Sharon Baptist Church for letting us borrow your parking lot. And the DNC Vice Chair, I tell you what, that man can make a speech, can’t he? He’s pretty darn impressive. Vice Chair Blake, for all you do for our party and all you do to get out the vote. And thank you Congressman Dwight Evans for coming out and speaking today. And for all of you, all of you, all you do to fight for the people of Philadelphia and every single day in Congress. I also want to say thank you to Bishop Hunter and Reverend Mark Tyler, State Representative Morgan. Where’s Morgan. Is he … there you go. Okay. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being here. And Bishop Louis Felton, and also want to thank Sharon Baptist choir, church choir. Aren’t they great? 
You know, one of the things I most enjoyed about being back on the campaign trail was meeting with the Black faith leaders all around the country. The churches I get to go to during the primaries and over 400 Black leaders, church leaders, supporting us. Almost every Sunday I’d get to sit in the pew and get inspired. I’d go to mass first early in the morning, then I go to the Black church to get some hope and some invigoration, man. I’d talked to people. I talked to people, hear what was on their minds. Pray with them. And that’s what, it was renewing. It was not about me, but our entire family. Jill would be with me and my grandkids. One of my grandkids is with me today, who’s a senior here in Philadelphia in college. 
I also thought a lot about this campaign. It’s been unlike any other campaign in history. There’s one thing that remains the same, we have to earn our democracy. We have to get out and vote. And as my late friend John Lewis reminded us, freedom is not a state, freedom is an act. We have to defend it. We have to vote. And this is the most important election of our lifetimes. We’re at an inflection point. So we have to vote like we never did before. Every day, every day is a new reminder of how high the stakes are, of how far the other side will go to try to suppress the turnout, especially here in Philadelphia. President Trump is terrified of what will happen in Pennsylvania. He knows if the people of Pennsylvania get to have their say, if you don’t have your say, he doesn’t stand a chance. 
But the American people, the American people will not be silenced. Over 90 million people have already voted. Already voted. They’ve had enough. They’ve had enough. There’s too much on the line to sit it out, but we only have two more days. Two more days we can put an end to this presidency that has from the very beginning sought to divide us, to tear us apart. 
Folks, in two days we can put an end to a president that has failed to protect this nation. In two days, we can put and end to a presidency that fanned the flames of hate, poured gasoline on every opportunity he had all across this nation. As I said, millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more will vote in the two days ahead, but there’s still a lot of Pennsylvanians who haven’t voted yet, and we need every single one of you to get out and vote on Tuesday. 
My message is simple, Pennsylvania is critical in this election. I live in Delaware, but I’m a Pennsylvania boy born in Scranton. And I want to tell you, the last time Donald Trump ran he won this state by 44,000 votes. So every single vote matters. The power, the power to change this country is literally in your hands. I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries, there is nothing, nothing he’s going to do to stop this nation from voting. No matter what he tries. 
And folks, when American’s vote, America will be heard. When America’s heard, I believe the message is going to be loud and clear. It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. Time to breathe some life back into this nation. We’re done. We’re tired of the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility. We got a lot of work to do. I’m I elected your president, we’re going to do it and we’re going to act and we’re going to start from the very first day. We’re going to act to get COVID under control. It’s almost criminal the way he has handled it. 
On day one of my presidency I’m going to put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months, masking, social distancing, testing, tracing, a plan for full and fair and free distribution of therapeutics, vaccines, when we get one. A plan to address the disproportionate way this virus … vaccines when we get a one. A plan to address the disproportionate way this virus has been hitting and devastating the black community across America. 
Folks, every single day we’re seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus. Higher infections rates, lower access to testing, harder time quarantining safely, lower access to quality treatment when you become infected, and tragically, higher mortality rates, three times as many African Americans are dying as white Americans … when they get the virus One in 100 Black Americans, excuse me, one in 1,000 Black Americans have died from COVID-19. And if we don’t change between now and January, it’s estimated one in 500 by the end of this pandemic. That is a mass casualty event in the Black community. And it’s totally unnecessary. Totally uncalled for. My public health plan will ensure the needs of communities that are being hit the hardest by this virus are a priority, not an afterthought. 
We’re going to have the plan to get our economy back on track. Not to get the back where we were, but to build back better, to make sure everyone is dealt in on a full scale share of the American dream. We’re going to address systemic racism and build real rural economic opportunity and equality for the Black community. The blinders have been taken off. The American people have seen, they’ve seen how bad things are. To make it easier to start a business, to buy your first home, to pursue an education after high school without being burdened with debt, to invest in HBCUs that do so much to mold Black leaders of tomorrow. 
I mean it. It’s not just talk. I mean it. We’re going to have to deliver racial justice in America. I see in all the protests here in Philadelphia and across the country a cry for justice. Folks, protesting is not burning or looting and violence must never be tolerated. It won’t. But the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, Walter Wallace Jr., they will not soon be forgotten. They will not be forgotten by me, they will not be forgotten by you, and they’ll not be forgotten by the American people because here’s what they’re going to do. They’re inspiring a new wave of justice in America. And George Floyd’s little girl, six years old, said to me when I went to be with the family … I knelt down to say hi to her and she looked at me and she said, “Daddy is going to change the world.” Daddy, that’s what she said to me. Six years old. Daddy. 
Look, we can change the world. Not in one fell swoop. We can change it. We all know this country has to come together. We can not afford four more years of anger, hate, and division that we’ve seen under this president. Folks, look, from the day he announced, from the moment he came down that escalator, what did he say in New York? He said, “We’re going to go out and get those rapist Mexicans.” Rapist Mexicans. He put a ban on all Muslims coming to the United States. And the way he talked about the African-American community. The way he talked about the Hispanic community. 
Look, folks, we got to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president for everybody. I will work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do support me. I mean it. That’s the job of a president, the duty to care, the duty to care for everyone. In President Biden’s America, there will be no red states or blue states, there will only be the United States of America. 
Look, our faith in our country is being tested, but our faith in God is helping us through because of all of you. Thank you for your commitment to the greatest commandment, love our neighbors as ourselves. And for our dedication to never grow weary of doing good. Being with you all reminds me of that gospel hymn that inspired so many of us. When I last talked to John Lewis, as he’s dying, he reminded me of it. I don’t feel no ways tired. I’ve come too far from where I started from. Nobody told me the road would be easy. I don’t believe he brought me this far to leave me. He did not leave us. We are not tired. The road hasn’t been easy, but we’ve come too far to stop now. 
So please vote. Get everyone you know to vote. We need to get every soul in Philadelphia to the polls. Your voice, your vote matters. Your voice deserves to be heard. And if you still have an absentee ballot, get it to a dropbox as soon as you can. Or you can vote on election day, but make a plan. And I mean it, make a plan now. Help get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/pa. 
Folks, folks, you know I’ve been doing this awhile. One of the reasons I got elected in the first place in Delaware across the line was because of the folks in Pennsylvania. All the media and Pennsylvania, all the media in Delaware for the first 25 years of my career was all Philadelphia television. There wasn’t no Delaware television. And I was very happy to have the moniker of being known as Pennsylvania’s third Senator. I know Philadelphia well. I married a Philly girl, by the way. And by the way, I got my Eagles jacket on. 
Folks, here’s what I want to say and I’ll conclude. You’ve been here a long time. I’ll never forget when President John F. Kennedy said, when he promised that we’re going to go to the moon. He said, he said words and my colleagues in the senate always used to kid me for repeating. He said, “We’re doing it because we Americans, we refuse to postpone.” Well, I refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities available to the American people. I refuse to postpone what we can do. There’s nothing beyond the capacity of the United States of America. Nothing. There’s no limit to America’s future. The blinders have been taken off. The only thing could tear America part is America itself. And that’s exactly what Trump’s been trying to do from the very beginning, dividing America based on race, religion, gender, national origin. It’s wrong. It’s not who we are. This is not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. 
Folks, and I mean this, this is not just campaign rhetoric. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction and yes, we choose truth over lies, the multiple lies he repeats. It’s time to stand up. It’s time to take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re better than this. We’re better than what we’ve been. We can be at our best. This is the United States of America. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. I love you. I love you. You brought me to the dance. Thank you, thank you, thank you. God love you all. 
Keep the faith. Every time I walk into my grandpop’s house in Scranton, walk out the door, Bishop B’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” When my grandmother was alive, she’d yell, “No Joey, spread it.” Let’s spread the faith."
9,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-barack-obama-campaign-event-speech-transcript-flint-mi-october-31,"Joe Biden & Barack Obama Campaign Event Speech Transcript Flint, MI October 31","Hello, Flint. Mr. President, thank you, thank you, thank you. It kind of reminds you how good it can be listening to him, doesn’t it? As my mother would say about Barack, “God love him. He’s a good man.” Folks, it’s good to be back with friends. [inaudible 00:04:54], Governor Whitmer, Lt. Governor Gilchrist, Debbie Stabenow, my good buddy Gary Peters, who you are going to send back to the United States Senate, because I’m going to need him. We can always count on him to be your Senator for you and your family. And my good friend, Congressman Dan Kildee, who we need to send back to the House. Dan’s a good man, a good man. And of course I wish we could figure out how to send back a guy who… 
We used to have an expression up in Scranton. We’d say when someone wasn’t somebody else’s equal, we’d say, “He wasn’t a patch on his jeans.” I tell you what, Mr. President, you’re still driving him crazy because he knows he wasn’t a patch on your jeans. I tell you what, Barack Obama, it’s great to be with the president again. It reminds me what we can be when you have a president of character, a president respected around the world, a president our kids looked up to and did look up to. I want to say something we don’t say often enough, and I mean this on the bottom of my heart. Barack Obama was a great president of the United States of America. 
And I want to make sure we say it here today. Mr. President, thank you, thank you, thank you. Went through eight years without one single trace of scandal, not one single trace of scandal. It’s going to be nice to return to that. Flint, three days. Three days. We can put an end to this presidency we have now that has divided the nation. Three days. We can put end to a presidency that has failed to protect this nation. Three days. We can put an end to this presidency that has fanned the flames of hate all across this nation and made us a laughingstock around the world. Millions of Americans have already voted. Millions more are voting today, tomorrow, and God willing, all the way through to the close of the polls on Tuesday. And my message is simple. The power to change the country is, not figuratively, it is literally in your hands. 
I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There’s nothing, let me say that again, there’s nothing that he can do to stop the people of this nation from voting in overwhelming numbers and taking back this democracy. And when Americans vote, no matter how many threats he makes, America will be heard. When America’s heard, I believe the message is going to be loud, and it’s going to be clear. It’s time for Donald Trump to pack his bags and go home. 
We’re done with the chaos, the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, refusing to take any responsibility. We’ve got a lot of work to do, got a lot of work to do. If I’m elected your president, we’re going to do it. We’re going to act. We’re going to need your help in doing it as well. We’re going to act to get COVID under control. On day one of my presidency, I’ll put in action a plan I’ve been talking about for months, already laid out, a national mandate. Mask wearing, social distancing, testing, tracing, all things, as President Obama just said, that should have and could have been put in place months and months ago. A plan for a full and fair, and free, I might add, distribution of therapeutics and vaccines when we get one. 
Imagine where we’d be if we had a president of wore a mask instead of mocking it. I can tell you this. We wouldn’t have 9 million confirmed cases of COVID in this nation, over 230,000 deaths. We wouldn’t be seeing a new record of cases we’re seeing right now. 90,000 cases yesterday. 90,000 new cases. By the way, 500,000 in just the past week. This guy tells us it’s going away. [inaudible 00:39:30] if he goes away. Folks, we wouldn’t be facing another 200,000 deaths in the next few months. This president knew in January the virus was deadly, and trying to improve his image. He tried to talk to Bob Woodward. He thought he could change his mind, but what he did, he let it be known all the way back in January, he knew how dangerous this pandemic was. And he hid it from the American people. 
He knew it was worse than the flu, but he lied to the American people. He knew it wasn’t going to disappear, but he kept telling us a miracle is coming. And yesterday, he had the gall to suggest that American doctors, people who are putting their lives on the line, on the front lines to save other lives, along with nurses and so many others, he suggested falsely that they’re inflating the number of COVID deaths to make more money. What in the hell is wrong with this man? Excuse my language, but think about it. It’s perverted. 
He may believe it because he doesn’t do anything other than for money. People of this nation have suffered and sacrificed for nine months, none moreso than the doctors in the front lines and healthcare workers. And this president is questioning their character, their integrity, their commitment to their fellow Americans. It’s more than offensive. It’s a disgrace, especially coming from a president who was waved the white flag of surrender to this virus. Our frontline health workers, they’ve given their all to beat the virus. We have a president who’s just given up. I will never raise the white flag of surrender. We’re going to beat this virus, and we’re going to get it under control. And the first step to doing that is beating Donald Trump. 
Look, Donald Trump keeps telling us what a great job he’s done as president. Oh, man. Well, did you know President Obama and I, as he pointed out, created more jobs in the last three years of our administration that he did in the first three years before the pandemic? How about this? Or did you know Donald Trump’s going to be the first president in nine years who’s going to finish his term with fewer jobs under his leadership than when he started? Look, that’s a lot of presidents. That’s a lot of crises, but only Donald Trump is going to have fewer jobs at the end of his presidency than when he started. You see, I and Barack understands something Donald Trump doesn’t. Wall Street didn’t build this country, you did. Working people built this country, and unions built the middle class. 
He’s done nothing but wage war on American labor. I see the UAW sign out there, first outfit ever endorsed me when I was a 29 year old kid. God love you. Look, we have a different view. We believe we should be rewarding work, not wealth, in this country. Under my plan, if you make less than $400,000 a year, you’re not going to pay a penny in additional taxes. But the wealthiest people, the biggest corporations… 91 of the fortune 500 companies paid zero in federal income tax last year. They’re going to start to pay their fair share. The super wealthy are going to pay the same rate they paid at the beginning of George Bush’s administration, and corporations are going to start to pay their fair share. Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher tax rate than someone making literally a billion dollars? Or should you? Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? He paid $750 in taxes, the one year we know of. I released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and look. He hasn’t released one. He talks about corruption. What is he hiding? He owes $41 million out there. Who’s he owe it to? If you notice, he’s the only president I know of that has secret bank account in China, paid 50 times more taxes in Beijing than he’s paid in the United States, and this guy talks about corruption. Look, we’re also going to act to protect healthcare. Trump and the Republicans just jammed through a Supreme Court nominee for one overwhelming reason. As Barack said- 
For one overwhelming reason. As Barack said, the president said, we have been, they have been trying over 50 shots to take out Obamacare, destroy the Affordable Care Act, but they’re going to be in court. I believe it’s seven days after the election. Win or lose, they’re going to be in court. If they get their way a hundred million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including more than 4 million Michiganders. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. Barack and I think it’s a right for people to have [inaudible 00:45:44] healthcare. We’re not only going to store Obamacare, we’re going to build on it. We’re going to keep your private insurance if you like it, and you can choose a Medicare like public option, if you don’t, we’re going to increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles. Out of pocket spending, reduce prescription drug costs by 60%. Look, we’re going to make sure you keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Meanwhile, Donald Trump laid out what he’s going to do in his second term, if he’s elected to [Social 00:46:17] Security. The actuary at the Social Security Administration says if he gets that plan passed, it will quote, bankrupt Social Security by 2023, something millions of Americans live on, paid for their whole life. When I said back six years ago, as Debbie will tell you, when I said the Republicans are going to try to eliminate Medicare, everybody said, “Nah, that’s crazy.” First thing Paul Ryan and Republicans in the Congress did, was cry to cut billions of dollars out of Medicare. These guys mean what they say. I’m going to protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, because there’s a lifeline for so many hard working folks. 
But folks I have to admit to you, it’s kind of personal with me. There’s nothing worse that this president has done in my view, than the way he speaks about our women and men in uniform, and those who have given their lives. He called them losers and suckers. My son, Beau, was a major in the United States Army, gave up the Attorney General’s job and petition to be able to go with his unit to Iraq for one solid year. After his US attorney, being in Kosovo, I might add I’m going to be a typical dad, he’s the only foreigner in Kosovo that has a 12 foot memorial dedicated to him. 
The major highway they built, the Beau Biden Highway because of his commitment. My son came home with a bronze star that could speak with his service but like so many others before he passed away. But guess what? He wasn’t a sucker. He wasn’t a loser, nor any of you who served, you’re patriots. And just like all of your sons and daughters, your parents or grandparents who serve. The president likes to portray himself, I love this, likes to portray himself as a tough guy. 
When you’re in high school, wouldn’t you have liked to take the shot? Anyway, that’s a different story, but anyway, a macho man, but when’s the last time you read about, saw or heard about a president of United States, literally be laughed at by world leaders when he spoke to the United Nations, laughed at out loud. When’s the last time you saw a president of United States being openly mocked by the leaders of NATO at a NATO conference? And can you believe we have a president who acts like Vladimir Putin’s puppy. Putin put boundaries out in the heads of American soldiers, serving in Iraq. And Trump was too scared to challenge him. Talk to him six time he’s never mentioned it. Trump’s not strong, he’s weak. He commands little respect to the international stage. This is the president who not only doesn’t understand sacrifice, you don’t understand courage, physical courage it takes to serve in uniform in a war zone. 
Maybe that’s why six generals and admirals who worked for him left his administration and said he was unfit to command, be commander in chief. When’s is the last time any president has had that happen? Tough guy. That’s why [Joy’s 00:50:07] special operations’ commander, General Stanley McChrystal. That’s why head of the Navy Seals, the one who saw the rate of Bin Laden, Admiral Bill McRaven, and 22 other four-stars have endorsed me say they support me to be their next commander in chief because like Obama and Bush and before him, they know we respect them, we support them. 
I’ve been in and out of war zones as Senator and vice-president over 35 times. I tell you what, these folks we have, only 1% of the country is in the military. We owe them, they’re the backbone, they’re the sinew, they’re the heart of who we are. That’s why we have to support our military and get rid of Trump. Folks, I want to tell you something, think about this. This is a guy who says there’s no such thing as climate change, he calls it a hoax. I see it as jobs, health, and safety. The impacts on climate are too often fall disproportionately on poor communities and communities of color. We’re going to make sure communities benefit from the hundreds of billions of federal investment in infrastructure and climate change. We’re going to do as a consequence of the change in the structure. 
We’re going to create local jobs to rebuild roads, fill sidewalk cracks, install broadband, create spaces to live, work, and play safely, to modernize infrastructure so you can turn on the faucet and clean water comes out. And when that happened in Flint will never happen again, anywhere in America. We can and must do this. Donald Trump has rolled back more than 100 environmental protection laws, many inactive under Barack and me. It’s also a host polluter, I’ll call polluters accountable with the most ambitious environmental justice agenda ever. Folks, we’re going to act to deliver on racial justice in America. Protesting is not burning or loading. Violent acts cannot be tolerated and it won’t, but these protestors is a cry for justice, the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten. They’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. America has had their eyes opened up, they’re ready. Look, I believe this country has to come together. 
I know when I announced well over a year ago, when I said I wanted to unite the country, everybody said, “That’s naive. That was a long time ago. You did it before Biden, but you can’t do it again.” Oh, we can and we must, we have no choice. That’s how democracies work. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president, I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care, duty to care for everyone. So please vote, you still have an absentee ballot. Get it to a drop box as soon as you can. You could also safely vote earlier until Monday afternoon, or you can vote on Election Day, just make a plan, help get out the vote. As you’s heard this 10 times already, visit, iwillvote.com/mi. Folks, we have such an incredible opportunity. 
Well, God love you. Thank you very much, but here’s the deal guys. We got to vote up and down the ticket here. I honest to God believe, I give you my word as a Biden. I honest to God believe we’re in the cusp, we’re in an inflection point, we have a chance to make such enormous progress because the American people have seen what the other looks like. They’ve gotten a glimpse of the abyss. I really mean it, they’re ready. They’re ready to change so much. I’ll never forget what president Kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon. 
He used the phrase that has guided me. He said, ” We’re doing it because quote, we refuse to postpone.” Well, I refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities to the United States of America for the American people. There is nothing beyond our capacity. There is no limit to America’s future. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of this campaign, divided America, pinning Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, it’s wrong. It’s not American, that’s not who we are. Folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. We choose science over fiction and yes, we choose truth over lies. 
My fellow Americans it’s time for us to stand back and stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this, we’re so much better than we’ve been. We can be what we are at our best. The United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
10,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-transcript-milwaukee-wisconsin-october-30,"Joe Biden Campaign Speech Transcript Milwaukee, Wisconsin October 30","Well, this young woman is the co-founder of Phoenix, of Sherman Phoenix, in Milwaukee, taking a neighborhood that was beginning to be a part of the ash then, and has brought it back to life miraculously. I am so proud to introduce Joanne Sabir. Come on, girl. 
I hope you got masks on everyone. It’s cold. Hello Milwaukee, it’s good to be back. I’ll tell you what, they told me it’s going to be indoors. You’re a hardy bunch in Milwaukee. Sheriff, how are you doing? Look, Terrence, thank you. Thank you for sharing your story. Thank you for your exercising your power as a young voter first time. You’re an inspiration man, and I want you to know that a lot of us in here growing up as kids understood what is like to know bullies. 
I had planned on saying this in light of your introduction, Sheriff and Tom’s heard me say this before, and the mayor. When I was a kid, I used to stutter. You want to learn what bullies are like, be a stuttering kid, talk like that everybody thinks they can make fun of you. So I’m used to bullies. Matter of fact, they used to have a nickname in school, Tom. They used to call me Shoe Leather. The reason they call me Shoe Leather, I was a little [inaudible 00:03:32], but you could beat me, but I’d hurt you. It’s like [inaudible 00:15:36] a shoe leather. 
But I’ll tell you what, I think you made a great metaphor about what’s going on here. You’re making your family really proud. And Joanne, I want to thank you for all you do to lift up this community, bringing pride and dignity and jobs in Milwaukee. My dad used to have an expression, he lost his job in Scranton, Pennsylvania when I was a kid and he took us to my grand pops, my mom’s dad, my grand mom was passed. And so he said you’re going to live here for about a year. I’m going to commute every day from Scranton, Pennsylvania, down to Wilmington, Delaware, where there’s jobs, Joey and when I get one, I’ll be back for you, and your mom, and your brother and your sister. 
My sister is with me today too, where’s my sister, Valerie? She’s my best friend in the world. Anyway, Val. And he said, it’s only 157 miles away. Wilmington, Delaware. He’d come home every weekend. And when we got down to Wilmington and he finally got a job, that we could bring us down and be able to rent an apartment, he used to always have an expression Sheriff, he’d say, “You know Joey, a job’s a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay. It’s going to be okay.”” 
As Gwen knows, not an awful lot of people out there right now. A lot of hard working people who can’t say it’s going to be okay, they’re in trouble. Statistics show, for example that over 50% of the American people think actually it’s 49% to be precise, got a bill for 400 bucks in one month they didn’t anticipate, they’d have to borrow the money or sell something. So a lot of people were still hurting. And Gwen, let’s send her back because I tell you what, she is a voice from Milwaukee, a voice from the country, and I’m sure glad you’re on my side, kid. Sure glad you’re on my side because I’m on yours. 
I want to thank you all for welcoming me today and Tom, you’ve been a good friend and for a long time, thank you pal. Tom endorsed me when they said Joe Who’s running for what? Anyway, but thank you, Tom. And Sheriff Lucas and Sheriff Mahoney, and Ambassador John [Frenz 00:06:06], I want to thank you all for being here, there you are. Okay. 
Look, it’s great to be back with you. Folks, there was only four days left. Millions of Americans have already voted. They’re telling me now it’s up to about 85 million Americans have already voted and millions more are going to vote before this election is over. 
And I believe when you use your power, the power to vote, you can change the course of the country and quite frankly, right now the course of the world, because it’s leaderless now. We’re going to start right here in Wisconsin. If Tom remembers, I came up here to campaign for Hillary and for a whole lot of reasons, not all which were her fault ended up not taking it as seriously. We thought it was different. I’ve been here a lot. And by the way, when I got elected, if I get elected, I’m coming back, Tom. 
Look at these final days, we got to keep our sense of empowerment here. A sense of optimism. What we can do together. But I know it’s hard. More than 225,000 people, I think it’s 229 as I speak, have already lost their lives to COVID-19. 2,000 here in Wisconsin, 600 here in Milwaukee County, each one immortalized by an empty chair this morning at breakfast or tonight at dinner. An empty chair at MacArthur Square. And now folks are getting hit by a new big wave of infections across the country. 
This week, Wisconsin, like other states set a new record for daily cases. Hospitals are running short on beds, just had to open a field hospital. That’s what we’re facing. We’ve now had nine million cases in the United States of America. We make up 4% of the world’s population,, we have 20% of the world’s deaths, nine million new cases nationwide, another tragic milestone, millions of people out of work, on the edge, and they can’t see the light, they’re not sure how dark it’s going to remain. 
Wisconsin is down 20,000 manufacturing jobs since this pandemic began. And the thing that bothers me the most was a president who gave up. Over the weekend, his chief of staff said what we knew. “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” We’re not going to control the pandemic. 
Yet last week when I debated the president, he said, quote, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning to live with it.” You may remember what I said it may have been viewed as harsh by some. Told him, we’re not learning to live with it, you’re asking us to learning to die with it, because people continue to die. It’s estimated that over 200,000 more people will die between now and the end of the year by the leading experts who haven’t been wrong yet. 
Did you hear what he said today? He said today at a rally that our doctors are the problem because they’re putting their lives on the line, busting their necks, he said, they’re making up deaths from COVID-19 because they get more money. They’re making up deaths. People aren’t really dying from COVID, they’re dying from other things, but they’re saying it’s COVID to make the numbers go up. My Lord. 
By the way, is Monica [Wadry 00:21:53] here? Monica is an ICU nurse. I spent some time with Monica on the phone and her two kids and Monica told me what my son-in-law who’s a doc in Philly told me when this all began. While we’re waiting for PPP, the mask, and the gowns, and all the gear, so many docs, so many nurses, so many first responders after they did their job were afraid to go home because they’d take it home, the virus home to their children. 
Monica told me how her husband would wait in the garage so she could change and put on a [inaudible 00:22:32] before she went in the house and shower. So many people, over a thousand Monicas have given their lives trying to save other lives. And this guy says that they’re raking it up because they want to make more money. 
Doctors and nurses go to work every single day, Donald Trump should stop attacking them and start doing his job. This is the same man who told us, when he was told about four weeks ago, three or four weeks ago that we’re losing a thousand lives a day, remember what he said? He said it is what it is. Ain’t that useful? It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s the problem. 
Donald Trump waved the white flag, surrendered to the virus. But the American people don’t give up. We don’t give in. Unlike Donald Trump, we’re not going to surrender to this virus. We’re simply not going to surrender. Look, I put in place a plan with this pandemic responsibly. I’ve set it up back in May, and then again in June, and in July, the way we can bring this country together around testing, tracing and masking. It’s estimated by leading doctors in America that if we just wore these masks for the remainder of this calendar year- 
For the remainder of this calendar year, we could save up to another 100,000 lives. Dr. Fauci, who’s been not treated very well by the President, who’s been with three other presidents in the same role, one of the most respected guys in the world, he’s called for a basket mandate. This isn’t a political statement of us wearing these masks. For God’s sake, it’s a patriotic duty. 
The reason you’re wearing the mask is not to save yourself, but to save your neighbor, the person across from you, the person who you’re next to. But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to the science. He’s politicized the race for vaccine as well. Instead of planning for its safe, equitable, and free distribution, what’s he doing? He’s talking about things that are just not in the rumble possibility, “We’ll have this by September. We’ll have it by…” it goes on. 
Look folks, he refused to bring leaders, by the way, of both parties together. You know, the House of Representatives, Gwen can tell you, has already passed three major pieces of legislation, two CARES Act, and then the Heroes Act, provides all the money that is necessary to safely open schools and businesses, and do it in a way that they can stay open. But it costs money, look at all the people who’ve gone out of business, all of the small businesses. 
We know how to open business, we know what to do it safely, but it costs, to open our schools nationwide, it’s estimated it’ll cost $200 billion to do it safely, to provide everybody with the PPE, [inaudible 00:25:50] everybody, change the ventilation systems, make sure you have separators, make sure you are in a position where we have the sanitary conditions that are wiped down, smaller classes, more teachers. But what are we doing? The money’s already been there, they’ve already passed it. What’s happened? The President hasn’t got out of his golf bunker in his golf course in the summer, or the bunker in the White House since then to bring people together. 
Look, find anybody Democrat or Republican, who served in the Congress, the Senate, the House, ask them can ever remember a time when there’s been a national crisis, and this is a national crisis, but the President hasn’t brought them all together, and said, “We’re staying here until we fix this. We’re going to work it out.” He hadn’t even talked to y’all. 
Look folks, we’re going to bring the Republicans and Democrats together, and deliver economic relief for working families, and schools, and businesses; I promise you. I know how to do this. As I said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m going to shut down the virus. 
Look, Donald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, but he squandered that economy, just like he squatted everything he’s inherited. Frankly I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, guys who think they’re better than you because they have a lot of money, look down on you because they live in a better home. But tell you what, we understand, we understand how this works. Folks, the people who built this country weren’t Wall Street, and investment bankers, and CEOs, they were hard working Americans, middle class folks, working class folks, who built the middle class, and unions built the middle class. 
We know, as Gwen said, we can build back better, with an economy that rewards work not well. Right now it rewards wealth, not work. We can do without raising taxes on any [inaudible 00:28:10] working person in the middle-class. I give you my word as a Biden, if you make less than $400,000, if I’m elected president, you’re not going to see a penny of your taxes go up, not a penny. 
He keeps lying about my plan, but I tell you what, I’m going to ask the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations, by the way 91 of the fortune 500 companies pay no tax at all, zero, zero tax. They make billions of dollars. 
Folks, it’s about time people start paying their fair share. It’s not a punishment. Pay your fair share. Why should a firefighter, why should a sheriff, why should a cop, why shouldn’t educator, why should a nurse pay a higher tax rate, which you do, then they pay? You do that, you pay a higher tax rate. 
And by the way, why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump? 750 bucks. This guy loves talking about corruption. I’ve released 22 years of my tax returns. You can go online and see them. And guess what? He hadn’t released one single year of his tax returns. What the hell was he hiding? What’s in there? Working families and middle-class people, you need help, they need help. Particularly first-time home buyers, being able to pay for a healthcare premium, childcare, carefree for your aging loved ones. 
Just to get a new hot water, and I don’t know about you, but the kitchen tables I was raised around, you’re sitting there, and I can hear my dad now, “Well, we can’t get those four new tires, you’re going to have to ride on those bald tires a little while longer till we get by next month; when that hot water heater goes out, what are we going to do?” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to the community college because you don’t have the money. They are the conversations taking place all across America today, and what’s Trump trying to do? Raise your cost for standard of living. 
He’s going to be in the Supreme Court, even if we win, he’ll still be the Supreme Court, in nine days, or 10 days, asking the Supreme Court, with our new justice, who was put on the court for the purpose of destroying the Affordable Care Act, to rip it out root and branch, eliminate it all. 
If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions, including 2.5 million Wisconsinites, 2.5. So if you have diabetes, you ever had cancer, if you had breast… whatever it is, whatever your previous condition, you won’t be able to afford it because they can jack up the price beyond your capacity. Women will once again, once again, be charged more for the same health care that a man is charged for just because they’re a woman. People forget that that’s what it was before we passed the Affordable Care Act. 
Look, Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege; I think it’s a right people should have. If we all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, but we’ll strengthen and build on it. So you can keep your private insurance, or you could choose a Medicare-like option that will add to Obamacare, which we tried, which we wanted to do the first time, but couldn’t get the votes. We’ll increase subsidies to lower your premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending, and surprise billings. 
And we will reduce the cost of prescriptions by 60%. I’m not making that up. That comes from saying, we’re going to insist, and we have the votes to do it in this next election, that Medicare can negotiate with the drug companies to say how much they’re going to be willing to pay for whatever drug they have. Look, folks, we’re going to make sure we keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 
Meanwhile, social security, the actuary of social security has said, if Donald Trump gets reelected, he says he’s going to change social security, based on the changes he wants to make the actuary and social security said, “Social security will be bankrupt by 2023.” I’m not making this stuff up, it’s real. Folks, I’m going to protect social security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And guess what? He’s not going to be able to do it because we’re going to win this election. 
Look, let’s not forget how weak Donald Trump has been, and chaotic. He talks about trade policy, my God, what a disaster he’s been. Trump’s trade policy has decimated, devastated the Wisconsin dairy industry. In 2017 to 2019, Wisconsin lost 15% of its dairy farms, and last year Wisconsin lost more dairy farms in any state in the nation. Since the start of the trade war, Wisconsin has seen mass lay off surge by 25%. And even before COVID hit, Wisconsin saw big declines in manufacturing jobs. 
After Trump rolled out his irresponsible tax giveaways, Harley Davidson slashed 800 manufacturing jobs, repurchased almost $700 million of its own stock so the corporate heads could get and make a lot more money, and none of it went to the employees, and then shifted some of its production overseas; so much for helping. 
Look, my policies… Right now, by the way, the deficit with China is higher than it was in our administration. Look, at the end of the Trump tax loopholes that incentivized companies to ship jobs overseas, these new laws just got passed for real, adds 10%, I’m going to add a 10% surtax to any company to ships jobs overseas. And companies that invest and strengthen the American manufacturing, or bring jobs back home, we’re going to offer a 10% tax credit. 
And by the way, the president of United States awards over $600 billion in contracts a year for our military, for all the things we build, federal buildings, well it’s not a violation of any trade law, no one’s done it, but I promise you I’m going to do it; not a single solitary contract will be awarded, unless all the products used by that contractor are made in America, all of them, right here in America. 
And by the way, when I talk about my economic plan, it’s not some liberal think tank that talks about how good it is; Moody’s, a Wall Street major firms pointed out, after looking at my plan for the economy and his, that we will create 18.6 million jobs under the Biden plan, a trillion dollars more in GDP than Trump. Folks look, the fact is that we’re now in a situation where this President is in a- 
We’re now in a situation where this President is in a position that he doesn’t know what he’s doing. If you notice, if you notice what Donald Trump has spent a lot of time doing, he spent a lot of time rolling out irresponsible corporate tax cuts. In the meantime, do you realize that during this pandemic, the billionaires in America, billionaires, they’re all listed, have made over $300 billion more? $300 billion more? How about you guys? You’re all doing great, right? You got all that money. Look, folks. We’re in a situation where the President now finds himself… The thing that bothers me most about all he’s done is the way he talks about our military being suckers and losers. Think about this. A lot of you women and men served in the military. A lot of us [inaudible 00:36:58] served. My son Bo gave up the Attorney General’s job in the state of Delaware to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the conspicuous service medal. He came home with cancer after being near [inaudible 00:00:37:14]. He came home anyway. He was given months to live, and guess what? He wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot, just like your sons and daughters, your parents and grandparents. Look, folks. If you ever wonder, Trump keeps talking about how strong he is. He’s strong and the rest of the nations listen to him. Everybody’s afraid of him. Well, let me tell you what. He’s the first President I’m aware of in American history that six generals, including his former Chief of Staff, six of them left, resigned, and said he wasn’t fit to be Commander in Chief. 
General Stanley McChrystal, Special Operations Commander. He’s the guy oversaw the Bin Laden raid. Bill McRaven, and 22, he oversaw. He was a SEAL. He head up the SEALs. And 22 4-Stars have endorsed me, saying they trust me to be the next Commander in Chief of the United States Military. Folks, it’s about respect. It’s about support, and that’s why the Military Times, which his staff tried to wipe out, Military Times just wrote an article saying more active duty troops support Biden than Trump. So much for the guy who talks about what a tough guy he is and why everybody listens to him. Look, that’s why we have to support the military, and we have to make sure we considerably invest more, which I don’t have to take the time to talk to you tonight about, but invest significantly more in dealing with the Veterans Administration. 
While Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can vote to deliver racial justice. Folks, a season of protest has broken out all over this nation, and protesting is not burning and looting and violence, and must never be tolerated and won’t. That’s not protesting. But those protests are cries for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, they’re not going to soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country. We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis as well. More frequent, extreme weather. Literally, the planet’s at stake. We’re told the number of years before it’s irreversible is getting narrower and narrower. The West is on fire. More forest land has been burned to the ground than the entire square miles of Rhode Island and Connecticut combined. 
The Midwest is flooding. Here in Wisconsin, extreme weather incurs big cost for your infrastructure. Lake Michigan set a record high this past January, and the South and East hurricanes are more severe. Oceans are rising. My state’s only three feet above sea level, literally. People are worried what happens if we don’t change this. Folks, Donald Trump thinks that when you say climate change, he says hoax. Well, this stable genius, as he calls himself, also thinks that wind power causes cancer. The way to stop hurricanes coming across the warm Atlantic from Africa is to maybe drop a nuclear bomb on them. The same stable genius said the problem we had in the Revolutionary War, we didn’t have enough airports. And of the Revolutionary War, God saved the… Anyway. 
Look, when I hear climate change, I think the health of our children, the security of the planet, and I also think it creates jobs. Jobs here in Wisconsin, all across the country. Folks, combating climate change means saving the planet, protecting our health, and creating millions of good-paying jobs, union jobs right here in Milwaukee and all across America. We can change the path we’re on, but we have to act now, because we can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. This election, I promise you, your grandkids are going to write about how it set the path for at least the generation here in America. 
You know, in 2008 and 2012, we came to y’all, Barack and me, and we asked for your help. You helped us, and each day we were in office, we worked for you and the entire country. I’m going to do that again. My 2020 campaign is a broad coalition. We welcome Democrats and Republicans and Independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. There will be no blue States or red States, just the United States. I’ll work as hard for those who vote against me as those who voted for me, because that’s what a president is supposed to do. The duty to care. The duty to care for everyone. 
Look, you too have a sacred duty to vote. It matters. Wisconsin matters. So if you haven’t already, and most of you probably have, make a plan, vote. Get out the vote. If you’ve already voted, get your mom, dad, brother, sister, neighbor. Get them to vote. Go to iwillvote.com/wi. You’ve got to get it done to make sure everyone knows where to vote, when to vote. Look, a press article yesterday, speaking of Donald Trump, two days ago, actually, said, and I quote, “Never before in modern presidential politics has a candidate been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to depress the vote as Donald Trump.” So let’s be careful here. Guess what? He’s not going to be able to stop us, not at all. As I said, he’ll not silence the over 85 million people who have already voted. They’ve had enough. People are coming out in droves, waiting three, four, five, six hours in other states just to vote. Let me conclude by saying I’l never forget the phrase used by President Kennedy when he decided to send us to the moon, get to the moon. He said, when asked why, he said, “We refuse to postpone. We’re the United States of America. We refuse to postpone the incredible opportunities available to the American people.” I refuse to postpone the enormous possibilities we have. I’ve been around a while, but I’d never been more optimistic about America’s chances than I am today. I really mean it. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. Nothing. There’s no limit to what America can do. We’re the only country in the history of the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than when we went in. 
The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself, and that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing from the beginning of his campaign, last time out. Dividing America, pitting Americans against one another based on race, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s let them know who we are, who we are in the last four days. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction, and yes, truth over lies. 
So folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy. We can do this. We’ll be better than we been. We can be who we want to be at our best, the United States of America. I promise you, we can do this. You helped me get there. I promise you, I’ll take responsibility. When I make a mistake, I’ll acknowledge it, but I will take responsibility and I won’t let you down. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Thanks, everybody. I appreciate it. You’ve got to be freezing. All right. They’re telling me I’m going this way."

Thanks. 
Hello, Minnesota. Jessica, thank you for being here and for sharing your story. Unfortunate it’s the story of so many other Americans. They have stories like your… Faced with health problems, fighting for their lives, and forced to think not only about facing the battle, but about how they can afford the treatment while insurance companies come in at the most vulnerable moments for you and your family members. I remember when my son Beau was lying in the hospital after he came home from Iraq after a year. He had stage four glioblastoma. They told him not whether he was going to live, but just how long would he live. As he lay there fighting for his life, fighting to hang on, I thought to myself, “What would it be like if in his suffering, my insurance company or his insurance company would come in and say, ‘You’ve run out of coverage. Time’s up. You’re on your own.'” Well folks, it’s a question no one should have to face in America. That’s why I fought so hard, why Obamacare was such a big thing? It’s unconscionable. 
It’s unconscionable that Donald Trump, from the day he got elected to right now, he’s fighting to court to rip that peace of mind away from tens of millions of Americans. But we’re not going to let him do it. We’re never going back to those days, and you’re going to vote. We’re going to win for you, Jessica, and your family. I promise you, I will protect your family as if it were my own. I want to thank all the speakers you heard earlier. Your governor, Tim, is great. He’s leading Minnesota with decency and integrity. And one of the outstanding members of Congress, Betty McCollum, let’s send her back to the House of Representatives. We need her badly. And your incredible Junior Senator Tina Smith, who I got to speak a little bit back here. She’s got to go back. 
And look, let’s win back the Minnesota state Senate while we’re at it. One of the nation’s finest leaders and a dear friend I’ve been honored to stand alongside and fight together for the soul of this nation for a long time, Senator Amy Klobuchar. Amy, I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Yesterday in Florida, I had a chance to spend a little more time with another Minnesota icon, Karl-Anthony Towns. You all have heard of him. Boy, he can play, man. Y’all know him as the heart and soul of the Timberwolves, but he’s also a son, who like many other Americans lost his mom to COVID-19 a couple of months ago. For all those sons and daughters, those parents, siblings, husbands, and wives facing empty chairs and dining room tables and with empty holes in their hearts, all those who reach over at night and [inaudible 00:40:19] just by instinct to say good night to their husband or wife, they deserve so much better. These guys are not very polite, but they’re like Trump. 
But look, they’re going to be okay. We’re going to take care of them as well. We need to come together. We need to fight for all these folks. We have four days left to get it done. Four days, and millions of Americans are already voting. Millions more will vote by Tuesday. I believe when you use your power, the power to vote will change the course of this country and the course of history. Right here in Minnesota, with all of you in the final days, keep that sense of empowerment. Keep that empowerment with you, that sense of optimism, what we can overcome. Now, look. There’s a reason they don’t want to hear me, because they know the president doesn’t say anything. So they’re not used to not hearing anything. 
But I Know it’s hard, folks. I know it’s hard. More than 228, I believe it is now, thousand Americans have died because of COVID-19. Nearly 2,500 here in Minnesota, gone. We had 9 million new cases nationwide. Millions of Americans are out of work, on the edge. They can’t see any light. They don’t know where it’s going. And Donald Trump, he’s simply given up. Over the weekend, White House counsel, chief of staff, he said the following, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” At the debate last week, Donald Trump turned to me and said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning to live with it.” But as I told him, “No, he’s asking us to learn to die with it.” We’re not going to. 
And did you hear what he said today? What he said today on the trail. He said that our doctors, our doctors, our first responders, over a thousand lost their lives, are putting their lives on the line, busting their necks, making up… He said, “But they’re making up deaths from COVID because they get more money.” The president of the United States is accusing the medical profession of making up COVID deaths so they make more money. Doctors and nurses go to work every day to save lives. They do their jobs. Donald Trump’s should stop attacking them and do his job. Folks, this is the same man who weeks ago when he was told, “We’re losing a thousand lives a day,” you remember what he said? He said, “It is what it is.” That’s thoughtful. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. Donald Trump has waved the white flag and surrendered to this virus, but the American people don’t give up. They don’t cower. Neither will I. 
Remember when he did that interview, and he told Bob Woodward that he knew about the virus and how deadly it was at the end of January, but didn’t tell anybody. He didn’t even tell those folks. He didn’t tell anybody. And Woodward asked him why, and on tape he said, “Because they didn’t want to panic the American people.” The American people don’t panic. Donald Trump panics. And unlike Donald Trump, we will not surrender to this virus. Look, President Trump is spreading division and discord. He thinks that he can divide us. We won’t notice his failures. That’s what it’s all about. That’s why he shamelessly equates Somali refugees, folks seeking a better life in America, contributing to this state and our country, with terrorists as he did last night. We need a president who brings us together, not pull us apart. I’ll deal with this pandemic responsibly, bringing the country together around testing, tracing, masking. It’s estimated by the leading doctors in this country that if we just wore a mask for the next few months, we’d save over a hundred thousand- 
… wore a mask for the next few months, we’d save over 100,000 lives of over 200,000 lives they expect to lose. Dr. Fauci called for a mask mandate last week. This isn’t a political statement, like those ugly folks over there, beeping the horns. This is a patriotic duty for God’s sake. 
Look, in his own words, as I said, the president knew back in January how extremely dangerous and communicable this disease was. And I told you, he went on and he made that tape. He said the disease was easily able to spread, but he did nothing. He did nothing at all. 
Look, folks, American people, our people are tough. And instead of talking and politicizing the vaccine, he should be planning for a safe, equitable, and free distribution of a vaccine when it comes next year. This guy refused to provide schools and small businesses the resources and the national standards to open safely. The House of Representatives already passed the money to allow schools open safely, businesses open safely, to make sure people are paid. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we’ll bring Republicans and Democrats together to deliver economic relief for working families, schools, and businesses. As I said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m going to shut down the virus. 
Donald Trump inherited a strong economy that Barack and I gave him. But guess what? Like everything else he inherited, he squandered it, like everything he’s inherited. But we can build back and we can build back better with an economy that rewards work not wealth. We can do it without raising taxes on the middle class and working families. 
I promise you, you have my word, if you make less than $400,000 a year, you won’t pay a penny more taxes. But I tell you what, for the first time, in a long time, the wealthiest and biggest corporations are going to start paying their fair share. 91 out of the Fortune 500 companies paid zero taxes last year. Why? Why should a firefighter, an educated, and even that guy blowing that horn, why should he pay? Why should a nurse pay higher tax rates than the super wealthy? Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump pays? 
He’s exploited every loophole and tax code. He’s run a shell game to avoid paying taxes. If you notice, I’ve released 22 years of my tax returns. He’s not released one single year. What’s he hiding? Where’s the corruption. According to Trump, the reason why he only paid $750 is because he’s smart. Well, what does that make the rest of us to pay our fair share, Mr. President? 
We’re going to deliver tax relief for working families and the middle class. Help you buy your first home, pay for healthcare premiums, or childcare, or care for your aging parents, or be able to actually, actually pay for school. 
Trump got a Supreme Court Justice, the first time in separate happened while an election’s already started for one reason, he’s determined to do what he’s been trying to do for four years, destroy the Affordable Care Act. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for preexisting conditions. Complications with COVID-19 will be the next preexisting condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums or deny your coverage. And women will again be able to be charged more for the same health care as a man, just because they’re a woman. 
Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s your right. And if we all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, we’ll strengthen it and build on it. So you can keep your private insurance if that’s what you like, or choose a Medicare like option, the public option. We’ll increase subsidies, lower your premiums, the deductibles, out of pocket spending. Reduce prescription costs by 60% by allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug prices. We’re going to keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and we’ll protect Social Security and Medicare. 
Meanwhile, the Social Security Actuary said that if Donald Trump said, “Elect me again and I’m going to change Social Security.” The actuary said if the changes he puts in place occur that Social Security will be bankrupt in 2023. So go home and tell your parents, your grandparents just what Trump’s about to do. I’ll protect Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
But folks, nothing’s worse that this president has done than the way he spoke about those who served in uniform. He called them losers and suckers. My son, Beau, gave up the attorney general seat in the state of Delaware to volunteer to go to Iraq for a year. He won the Bronze Star, the Conspicuous Service Medal. He wasn’t a loser or a sucker. He was a patriot, so many of you as well. 
No wonder the six generals who worked directly for the Trump administration have left and they say, “He does not deserve to be the commander-in-chief of the United States.” That’s never happened to any president before, and that’s why Special Operations Commander Stanley McChrystal, Navy Seal Commander Admiral McRaven, along with 24 stars endorsed me, saying they support me to be the next commander-in-chief because they trust me. And that’s why the Military Times reported that more troops would vote for Biden than Trump. That’s why we have to support the military. They’re the backbone of the country. So let them vote and let’s vote for them. And when Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can deliver on racial justice. 
A season protests has broken out across the nation because the life and dignity of George Floyd, senselessly killed seven miles from here, and so many others that mattered. Protesting and burning and looting is not protesting. It’s violence, clear and simple and will not be tolerated. But these protests are a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country because true justice is also economic justice. Access to schooling, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs and financial stability. Giving families of color a real shot to own a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt-free so they can build wealth and pass down opportunity through the generations like the rest of us have. 
We have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country for everyone. And finally, we have to both to meet the challenges of the climate crisis. The West is on fire, losing more forest than the total land of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. The Midwest is flooding. Here in Minnesota, extreme weather occurs, incurs big costs for your infrastructure, increase flooding in the Mississippi. Watershed has shut down port facilities here and in Saint Paul. 
Donald Trump thinks it’s all a hoax. He sure is a stable genius. He says that wind power causes cancer. I say it creates jobs, Minnesota jobs. When combined, we can combat climate change. With American ingenuity and manufacturing, building a more resilient nation and creating millions of new high paying jobs. We can change the path we’re on. Nothing’s beyond our capacity. 
So honk your horns if you want American to lead again. Honk your horn if you want Americans to trust each other again. Honk your horn if you want to have civility again. And honk your horn if you want America to be united again. 
We cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. In 2008 and ’12, you placed your trust in me and Barack Obama, and each day we were in office, we worked for you and the entire community. I’ll do it again in 2020. My campaign is a broad coalition of Democrats, Republicans, independents, Republican office holders. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. 
I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as does you do, because that’s the job of a president. It’s the duty of care for everyone, and you too have a sacred duty, the duty to vote. It matters. Minnesota matters. So in the final days, stay empowered, staff domestic, stay united. Make a plan to vote, help get out the vote. As Amy said, go to Iowavote.com/mn. 
Yesterday, the Federal Fields Court forced a last minute change in the rules, absentee ballots have to be received by Tuesday. So if you want your voice to be heard, drop off your ballot, don’t put it in the mail, or vote safely in person any day up through election day. But you’ve got to get it done, and make sure everyone you know votes as well so they’ll not being able to stop us despite Trump’s efforts. A recent press article points out that quote, “Never before in modern presidential politics.” I’m quoting now, “Never before in modern presidential politics has a candidate been so reliant on wide scale efforts to repress the votes as Trump,” end of quote. 
We will not be silenced. Over 85 million people have already voted, 85 million. They’ve had enough. Look, I’ll never forget the words President Kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon, he said we were doing it because we in America, we refuse to postpone. I refuse to postpone the work America must do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to America, including guys like that. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself, and that’s exactly what Donald Trump has been doing for the beginning. Divide America, pitting Americans against one another, based on race, ethnicity, national origin. That’s wrong, that’s not who we are. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s keep showing them who we are. 
We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division, science over fiction, and yes, we choose truth over lies. So it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re so much better than this. We can be who we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. 
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks, appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks."
12,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-event-speech-transcript-des-moines-iowa-october-30,"Joe Biden Campaign Event Speech Transcript Des Moines, Iowa October 30","Hello, Iowa. Hello, Polk County. Hello, De Moines. Back at the state fair. God love you all. Thank you for being out here today. Folks, I want to thank Ross. Thanks for that introduction. Ross, my heart goes out to you. It really is. I know it’s hard, but you’ve been turning loss into purpose, saving lives. People who in fact ask me about my circumstances in the past said the best way to get through it is with purpose, find purpose. And you’ve done that. And Governor Tom and Christie Vilsack, my best buddies. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’ve done for me before, now, and God willing after. Jill and I will always be grateful, grateful for your support and your friendship. And folks, Cindy Axly, God loved her. And Amy Finkenhower, Abby Finkenhower. 
I tell you what, you guys are the single best Congress persons I’ve campaigned with. You need leaders like you right now. We need more of you. We need more. We’ve got to elect them both. And by the way, we need Readon in the Second District and J.D. in the Fourth District. It’s time we can change things a little bit here. Right? Time to change it. I tell you what, and how about Theresa? I’ll tell you what, you have no idea how much you’re going to make my night when you win. You have no idea. And how you’re going to make everybody else’s night. You are as they say back in Scranton, you’re the real deal, kid. You’re the real deal. And you’ve never forgotten where you came from. And the I’m confident about is even going to Washington as a U.S. Senator, you’re not going to forget where you came from and who you are. 
Your values are baked in. They’re Iowa values. They’re American values. You value honor, decency, respect, and dignity. You know they all matter. They matter a lot. That’s who we are. And as we saw in the debate, where a farmer’s daughter knows a breakeven point for a price of corn, crops. You think that’d be fairly basic. That’s like my not knowing where the Delaware River was back home. Folks, but there’s something else. Theresa and I both lost our first spouses. We’ve both been single parents with young kids. We both found a way back from broken places. And we know that’s why you should elect this woman, Theresa, to the United States Senate. She sees, she understands, she believes. When she talks to you, when you talk to her, you know, and I’m not just saying this, you know she understands, she gets it. 
Just like our good friend Tom Harkin was your Senator. Teresa will be your Senator for Iowa. Not like her opponent, who’s Donald Trump’s Senator for Donald Trump. Folks, only four days left. Millions of Americans are already voting. Millions more are going to vote by late Tuesday night. I believe, when you use your power, the power of a vote, we’re going to change the course of the country and quite frankly the world. Right here in Iowa with all of you in the final days. Please keep your sense of empowerment. Keep your sense of optimism of what we can do together, because you know we can do anything. You know how I know how hard it is. More than 200, and now I think it’s up to 30,000 people have died, Americans dead, because COVID-19. 
Nearly 1,700 dead right here in Iowa. Iowa hit a record number of daily cases yesterday. It was over 2,300, and a record number of hospitalizations, more than 600. We’ve now hit nine million cases nationwide, a tragic milestone. And millions of people are out of work, on the edge, and they can’t see the light. They don’t know. It just looks dark right now for them. 82,000 Iowa jobs lost in this pandemic and still they’ve not come back. 70,000 jobs lost in Iowa since Donald Trump became President. Here at the fairgrounds, the Iowa State Fair canceled for the first time since World War Two, and Donald Trump has given up. The White House Chief of Staff said it out loud last week. He said, “We’re not going to control the pandemic. We’re not going to control the pandemic.” In the debate last week with Donald Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away.” And only he could say, “We’re learning to live with it.” Well, maybe you remember what I told him, “We’re not learning to live with it. We’re having to learn to die with it because of you.” Donald Trump has waved the white flag. He surrendered to this virus. But the American people don’t give up. Remember what he said when he did that interview, he said, although he knew about the crisis, he knew how bad it was back in January, the end of January, he decided not to tell the people, because he worried there would panic. Well, guess what? We don’t panic. He panicked. And he misrepresented to us. Imagine if you had told us in January how dangerous this was and took action. It’s estimated there would be over 130,000 people still alive. 
By the way, we don’t cower. Nor do I and never will we. Unlike Donald Trump, we will not surrender to this virus. I’m going to put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, which I laid out back in March, bringing the country together around testing, tracing, masking. It’s estimated by the leading doctors in America that if you just wore those masks for the next between now and the end of the year, we would save, just putting this mask on, we’d saved 100,000 lives. It’s expected that 200,000 more lives will pass between having the end of the year. Dr. Fauci called last week for a mask mandate. This isn’t a political statement. It’s patriotic duty, for God’s sake. But still, Donald Trump refuses to listen to science. He politicizes the race for a vaccine instead of planning for its safe and equitable and free distribution. He refused to provide schools and small businesses the resources and national standards where they can open safely and stay open. Well, I’m going to bring together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief to working families and school … 
… together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief to working families and schools and businesses. The Congress has already passed this legislation. It’s sitting there, but he refused, he spent all his time this summer in his golf course bunkers or down in the white house bunkers, think about it. I’ve been around for a while, I bet even Senator Grassley would have to acknowledge that I don’t ever remember any President in a crisis where there’s a disagreement in the house and the Senate between Democrats and Republicans, didn’t even try to bring them together to deal with this. The house back in May passed the Heroes Act, which would allow businesses and schools to open safely because it costs money, you need sanitation, you need ventilation, you need masking, you need distancing, you need separators. It all costs money, but it’s sad, one in six businesses are now out of business, because he won’t act. I’ve said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy, I’m going to shut down the virus. 
Even before the virus Donald Trump had already blown it, he inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, well like everything else he inherited, he squandered it. He squandered it, frankly. I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, so have you. Guys who think because they have a lot more money that they’re better than you, look down on you. I know, I acknowledge I got a little bit of a chip on my shoulder coming from an Irish Catholic neighborhood where it wasn’t viewed as that being such a great thing. When I read something about how if I’m elected President, I’m going to be the first non-Ivy league person to occupy the white house in a long time. Well guess what? Like somehow, I didn’t belong if I didn’t go to the Ivy league. Look, I’ll say it about time, it’s about time that a guy or woman or graduate from a state university is able to sit in the oval office. 
Because if I’m sitting there, you will be too, you know who really built this country? It wasn’t Wall Street, it wasn’t CEO’s, it was hard working folks like all of you who built the middle class and unions helped build the middle class. We know how we can build a back and build it back better with an economy that rewards work for a change, not wealth. We can do it without raising the penny tax on the middle class. I guarantee you, give you my word as a Biden no one making less than $400,000 year will see a penny in their taxes raised, no one, but I tell you what, it’s about time. The wealthiest people in America, the billionaires, the trillionaires, the multi-billionaires and the biggest corporations start paying their fair share. 91 major corporations out of the Fortune 500 didn’t pay a penny in tax last year, that’s tens of billions of dollars. They’re going to pay their fair share. 
Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse, a cop pay a higher tax rate, which you do than a major multi-billion dollar corporation. Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump who paid $750? You want to know everything I don’t like about Trump? Let me tell you, I could capture it in one answer he gave. He was asked last time out about paying so little taxes, allegedly being a billionaire, know what he said? He says, “Because I’m smarter, I know how to game the system.” But he ain’t going to be gaming the system anymore in the Biden administration, they’re going to start paying. And we’re going to deliver tax relief for working families, the middle class to help you buy your first home, pay for healthcare premiums or childcare or care for an aging loved one, or being able to pay off your student debt for God’s sake. Look, where I come from it’s just about being fair. We’re not asking anybody to do any more than anybody else just be fair, decent. 
Trump got a Supreme Court Justice for overwhelming reason, by the way, never before has there ever been a hearing on a Supreme Court Justice once an election began. That’s never occurred, but you got his justice for one simple reason to destroy the Affordable Care Act. He’d been trying since the day he got elected, and if they get their way, $100 million people will lose protection for pre-existing conditions, including 1.3 million Iowans will lose it. Complications of COVID-19 are going to become the next preexisting condition. Allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, delay your coverage and a lot of young people don’t realize this, but before Obamacare insurance companies charged women more for the same healthcare they charge men because they could, that’ll end. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege, I think it’s a right. We all get out and vote. And by the way, they’re going to court in 10 days, 10 days, as he said to wipe it all out, end it, all of it. 
Well, I’ll restore the Affordable Care Act and I’ll strengthen and build on it, so you can keep your private insurance if you like it, or choose a Medicare like public option. We’re going to increase subsidies for lower premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket expenses, surprise billing. As Theresa said, this time, we are going to make sure Medicare can negotiate with the drug companies for prices reducing them by 60%. I promise you we’ll get that done. We’re going to make sure we keep protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Remember what he said when he talked about the people who were dying and not dying, he said, “Virtually,” this is a quote from Trump, “virtually nobody’s dying, except for people over 65 with heart conditions,” like they’re disposable. It doesn’t matter with this guy. No, I’m not joking. Think about it, think about it. And then when he was told for the first time like we did today, 1,000 deaths a day, remember what his comment was? He said, “It is what it is.” Well it is what it is because he is who he is, that’s why it is what it is. These guys are something else, man. And meanwhile, the actuary at the Social Security Department says if Donald Trump gets what he’s saying, he said, “You reelect me I’m going to change social security.” The actuary says, “If the change occurs that he is promoting, it will bankrupt social security by 2023.” Go home and tell your parents or grandparents that, that’s a fact. Theresa said I’ll protect social, security, Medicare, Medicaid. And let’s not forget how Donald Trump weak and chaotic China trade policy has cost farmers and manufacturing so badly. Agricultural exports to China during the Trump years have been 40% lower than during the Obama Biden second term. On his watch and this really bugs me, on his watch ethanol margins have tanked and Iowa’s manufacturing facilities are idle and even closing. He even says, I love this quote from him. He says, because of his bailouts, “Our farmers do better now than when they actually had a farm.” I’m going to read that again. “Our farmers are actually doing better now than when they actually had a farm.” Where’s this guy from? Who does he think he is? 
Look, I’ll do what he’s been unable to do, I’ll mobilize a true international effort to stop China’s abuses so we can strengthen manufacturing and farming in Iowa and across the country. I’m going to hold China accountable, which he hasn’t from the pandemic on. Folks. But there’s nothing worse in my view than the way he has spoken about those who served in uniform. He called them losers and suckers. My son, Beau, many of you knew volunteered to serve a year in Iraq, gave up the Attorney General’s job to do it. Won the bronze star, the Conspicuous Service Metal and other awards, he was neither a loser or a sucker, he was a Patriot. And Theresa, so is your son Dane, who was in the army, he’s a Patriot like all of your sons, daughters, and all of those of you who have served. 
It’s no wonder that the six top generals in the President’s administration left and said, “He does not deserve to be commander in chief,” his own generals in his own administration. No President has ever had that happen, none. And that’s why Special Forces Commander, Stanley McChrystal, general and the head of the Navy Seals, Admiral Craven, along with 20 other four star generals endorsed me saying they’d be proud to have me as commander in chief. A sitting President. And that’s why the Military Times quotes more troops would vote for Biden then Trump. Folks, it’s not about me, it’s about him. That’s why we have to support our military. You vote for me, you’re voting for them. And while Donald Trump fails to condemn White supremacy … 
And while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can vote to deliver racial justice. A season of protest has broken out all across America. And by the way, legitimate protesting is not burning or looting. Violence can never be tolerated and it won’t. But those protests are cries for justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake. They’ll not soon be forgotten, not by me, not by us, or not by this country. 
Folks, we ave to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis as well. More frequent, extreme weather. The West is on fire. We’ve lost more forest than the total space of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined, in the West. The Midwest I need not tell you is flooding. You know here in Iowa, the derecho, catastrophic floods and droughts that lay waste to lives, livelihoods and whole communities. And in the South and the East hurricanes are more severe. Oceans are rising. My state’s only three feet above sea level. People are already talking about the change we have to make. We don’t have a lot of time. Donald Trump, when you say climate change, he thinks hoax, and that stable genius, as he calls himself, continues to say wind power causes cancer. It’s the same guy who said, by the way you think I’m making this up, when he was advised about the increasing hurricanes coming across the Atlantic because of the warm water, he said, “Maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them.” Holy mackerel. 
This also a guy you may recall, the stable genius, he said, “The problem with the revolutionary war was we didn’t have enough airports.” And he talks about mental acuity? Whoa. Folks, you look at climate warming. You look at it the way I do. Creates jobs, Iowa jobs, jobs across America. You understand that here in Iowa we’ve already created thousands of good paying jobs because of your dominant in wind energy. And it’s expected that the number of wind jobs will double or triple by 2030 in Iowa. And notwithstanding that the stable genius says wind power causes cancer. Wind power helps save the planet, generates millions of dollars in economic growth, and provides good prevailing wage jobs. 
Folks, combating climate change means saving the planet, protecting our health, and creating millions of good paying jobs, Union jobs, in wind and solar and carbon capture. Iowa farmers were the first in the world to be in a position where they reach net zero emissions, because we’re going to make sure there’s a whole lot more land set aside and you get paid for it. Deep rooted products, emissions, reward them. Folks, we can do this. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. So honk if you want America to lead again. Honk if you want America to trust each other again. Honk if you want America to be united again. 
Folks, we cannot afford four more years of Donald Trump. In 2008 and 2012 you placed your trust in Barack Obama and me and we worked for you, for the entire country. Well, I’ll do it again in 2020. My campaign is a broad coalition, welcomes Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. In my administration, they’ll be no red states or blue states, just the United States of America. 
Folks, I mean this at the bottom of my heart. That’s the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone, to heal. And you too have a sacred duty, a duty to vote. It matters. Iowa matters. So in these final days stay empowered, stay united, stay optimistic. Make a plan to vote, vote early, vote on election day, help get out the vote. Go to I willvote.com/ia. 
Folks, this president has done everything to try to discourage us, to try to convince us that it doesn’t matter, all about illegal voting, all the stuff he’s putting up, but guess what? He will not be able to stop us at all. Despite Trump’s efforts, a recent press article two days ago said never before “in modern presidential politics has a candidate had been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to repress the vote as Trump.” End of quote. We will not be silenced. 85 million people have already voted so far. We’ve had enough. 
Folks, look, I’ll never forget as a kid, the words of President Kennedy about going to the moon. He used the phrase, he said, we’re doing it because, ” We refuse to postpone, or I refuse to postpone, incredible opportunities available to the American people.” There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There is no limit to our future. The only thing that can’t tear America, look, I’ll talk about how we’re in trouble. Well, nothing can tear America part, except America itself. And that’s exactly what Donald Trump is doing from the beginning. Trying to divide America, pitting Americans against one another based on race, gender, ethnicity, national origin. It’s wrong. That’s not who we are. 
Look, folks, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. We got to let him know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it’s time for us to stand up, take back our democracy. We can do this. We’re so much better than we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best, the United States of America. There’s literally not a thing we’ve ever been unable to do, nothing. The only country in the world that’s ever come out of every crisis stronger than it went in is United States of America. And with your help, I promise you, that’s what we’ll do again. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you."

Hello, Tampa. Thank you so much, Chloe. You guys look like you’re so far away, you may be in Delaware. Great to see you all. Thanks for so many of you being here. As my mother would say, God love you all. 
Chloe, thanks for sharing your story and for all that you do. We often say that a person contributes to their community, but how many people can you name who have done more for this city and its people than Chloe? Chloe, congratulations. Turned abandoned buildings and dangerous lots into places of life and hope, making sure that bringing the community together to build homes for local families and helping young people around Tampa learn job skills, instill pride and purpose in neighborhoods that have been left behind, and laying the groundwork for economic opportunity that endures through generations. That’s the sort of work that changes the world. So thank you, Chloe. Thank you. 
I also want to thank all the other speakers here tonight, including your remarkable mayor. Jane, you’re something else, kid. Thanks for the passport into town. I appreciate it. And my friends, and these are my friends, Congressman Charlie Chris. You were there in the beginning, Charlie. Thank you, pal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And Kathy Castor, her district. I sought permission to come. She said, “Okay.” Thanks Kath. And Alan Cohn, who we’ve got to send to Congress. And I just spent some time with one of my best buddies. A guy I served with for a long time in the United States Senate, Bill Nelson. I haven’t served with anyone with more character, courage and decency than Bill and his daughter, Nan, and his son, Billy, as well as amazing Grace who is with him. She’s something else, isn’t she? 
Look folks, five days left. Five days, but who’s counting right? But who’s counting? Scranton. I got a Scranton sign here. I don’t know, man. I’m getting… Wilmington. I’m getting confused here, man. Millions of Americans have already voted, over 75 I’m told. 75 million and millions more are going to vote before this is over. And I believe when you use your power, the power of the vote, we literally are going to change the course of this country for generations to come. 
We’re going to do it both at home and abroad right here in Florida with all of you. You’re the ones who built this country. CEOs and Wall Street didn’t build this country. You did. No, not a joke. I’ve been saying this for years. Middle class people did, hardworking folks and unions built the middle class I might add. And you’re the ones who are going to save this country. 
Look, I said, I got in this race for three reasons a year ago, little over a year, and I meant it. The first was to restore the soul of this country. This is not who we are, is not who we are. We’re more decent, honorable. We’re more respectful. We’re better people than we’ve been seen from this administration. Second reason was to restore the backbone of this country, the middle class and bring everybody along this time. And thirdly, to unite this country. We have to unite us. These final days, keep that sense of empowerment with you. That sense of optimism, what we can do, what we can overcome. That’s the God’s truth. I’ve never been more optimistic about America and America’s chances than I am today. Because I know the American people. I know who we are. We have never, ever, ever, ever let the country down and give it a chance. And on November 3rd, we’re going to unite this country and show the world who American really is. 
I mean it. I know it’s hard. Over these past few months has been so much pain, so much suffering, so much- 
So much pain, so much suffering, so much loss in America. More than 225,000 people dead, 225,000. The estimates are, if we’d have acted responsibly, there’d be 160,000 fewer dead than there are today, because of COVID-19. We’re now past the nine million mark of people infected. More than 16,000 people in Florida have been lost, and millions of people are out of work, on the edge. They can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s like that old bad joke of my generation, it’s a freight train, because that’s what happens if he stays in office. Donald Trump has given up. Over the weekend, the White House Chief of Staff said, and I’m quoting, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” It’s obvious he’s not. 
At the debate last week with Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning to live with it.” Remember what I told him? He’s asking us to learn to die with it. That’s what’s happening. Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to this virus. But the American people never give up, we never give in, and we surely don’t cower. And neither will I. Donald Trump just had a super spreader event here again. They’re spreading more than just coronavirus. He’s spreading division and discord. We need a President that’s going to bring us together, not pull us apart. I’ll put a plan in place to deal with this pandemic responsibly, bringing the country together around testing, tracing, masking. Leading doctors in America, including Trump’s own CDC Director and Dr. Fauci last week said that if we just wore a mask, between now and the end of the year, we’d save 100,000 lives. 
Folks, that’s not a political statement. It’s a patriotic duty, for God’s sake. But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to science. And we shouldn’t be politicizing the race for a vaccine. We should be planning for its safe use and free and equitable distribution, providing PPE for national standards for school, businesses to open safely. I laid out a plan back in May how to do that, bringing together Republicans and Democrats to deliver economic relief. That’s already passed by the Democratic House of Representatives for working families, for schools and businesses. I’ve said it before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country. I’m going to shut down the virus. 
Donald Trump inherited a strong economy from Barack and me, just like he inherited everything in his life. Oh, it’s a fact. He squandered that economy like he squandered everything else. But folks, I promise you, I guarantee you, we can build back and build back better with an economy that rewards work not wealth, and we can do it without raising taxes a single solitary penny from working class or middle class families. I guarantee you, my word as a Biden, no one making less than $ 400,000 will pay a single penny more in taxes. Not a penny. But I tell you what I’m going to do, and I make no apologies for it, I’m going to ask the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations of the Fortune 500 companies, 91 making a collective billions of dollars, didn’t pay a single solitary penny in federal tax. Well, I’m going to make sure they pay their fair share. 
Why should a firefighter, an educator, a nurse pay at a higher rate than the super wealthy or corporate America? Because you do, you do. Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump pays? If we made this as a movie 10 years ago, people would think we’re making it up. But it’s true. We’re going to deliver tax relief for working families of the middle class to help you buy your first home, help you pay for health care premiums, for childcare, for caring for your aging loved ones, for eliminating college debt. We’re going to take care of this. And we can afford it. Look, Trump got his Supreme Court Justice, and he did it for one overwhelming reason, something he’s been trying to do since the day he got elected, to destroy the Affordable Care Act. He’s going at it again. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose protections for pre-existing conditions, cancer, all diseases that are out there. 
Folks, look, 8.4 million Floridians have pre-existing conditions. Complications of COVID-19 will become the next pre-existing condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, deny your coverage. A lot of you young people don’t even realize it, but before we passed the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies charged women more for the same healthcare as men, just because they were women. Fact, Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s you’re right. If we all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, we’ll strengthen and build on it, so you can keep your private insurance if you like it, and you can choose a Medicare like option if you don’t. We’re going to increase subsidies and lower your payments and deductibles and premiums, out-of-pocket spending, reduce the unknown billing, reduce prescription drug costs by, according to the experts, up to 60%, by allowing, not making this stuff up, by allowing Medicare to negotiate for drug prices. 
We’re going to make sure you keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. We’re going to protect social security and Medicare, which they’ve been trying to cut for years. Meanwhile, the social security actuary, the guy who runs it, says the plan like Donald Trump says he wants to institute if he gets reelected, he says will bankrupt social security by 2023. As my wife would say, “Google it.” You’ll see what I’m telling you. You’ve got that right, pal. He said, “Trump is bankrupt.” By the way, he probably is. He owes $400 million to somebody. Anyway, folks, we have to vote. We have to vote for our military families. No, not a joke. Folks, of all the things Donald Trump has said, nothing has bothered me worse than the way he’s spoken to those who served in uniform. He called them losers and suckers. 
Losers and suckers. My deceased son, Beau Biden won the Bronze Star, Conspicuous Service Medal and other awards. Volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, gave up his attorney general job to go with his unit. He wasn’t a sucker, or a loser. He was a patriot. Like all of you who served. Like your sons, your daughters, your parents, and your grandparents. We have to vote for their dignity, respect they are due. We have to vote because while Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy, we can deliver racial justice while he’s trying to make it worse. Look, Donald Trump doesn’t believe that systemic racism is a problem. He won’t say black lives matter. We know they matter. That’s why a season of protest has broken out across the nation. But by the way, protesting is not burning or looting. Violence must never be a tactic tolerated, and it won’t. But these protestors are in a cry for justice. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake will not soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country. When I met with the family, his little daughter said, looked at me and she’s only about seven years, and I knelt down to talk to her and the family. She looked at me, and she said, “Mr. Vice President, my daddy is changing the world.” Well guess what? The inspiration coming from her daddy would happen, this new wave of justice in America. But true justice is also more than just dealing with abuse. It’s about economic justice. It’s about schools, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs, a minimum wage of a minimum of $15 an hour. Financial stability. Giving families of color a real shot to own their own home, start a small business, send a child to college debt-free, so we can build wealth and pass on opportunities through generations like we did like, so many middle-class families have in the past. But we have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country. We have to vote to meet the challenge of climate crisis. Because you know in Florida, it is a crisis. 
We’re all seeing the impact more than most. Devastating hurricanes to lay waste to all communities. Economic toll is astounding, and it grows every year, but the human toll is worse. Lost lives, lost homes, small businesses shattered. First responders put at risk from the West Coast burning, the middle part of the country flooding. Donald Trump when he thinks of climate change, he says hoax. Well, guess what? Speaking of hoaxes, remember what he said about these increasing violent hurricanes and the frequency? He actually said, maybe we should detonate a nuclear bomb over the Atlantic. By the way, the same stable genius who said, the biggest problem we had in the revolutionary war is we didn’t have enough airports. Whoa. Man, I tell you, what. His answer to families in Puerto Rico, struggling through Hurricane Maria was, what would he do? Toss rolls of paper towels at them. He doesn’t have any real answers. We know we can do something about it while combating climate change means jobs. We can unleash American ingenuity and manufacturing and build a stronger, more climate-resistant nation, creating millions of new high paying jobs. 
We can change the path we’re on. We’ve got to act now. Time is running out. This country can’t afford four more years of Trump, who thinks he’s only responsible to the people who voted for him. I don’t see the presidency that way. I see an American as an American. I’d run as a proud Democrat. But guess what? It’s starting to rain, and I’m going to shorten this for y’all. I don’t see America that way. In 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in Barack and me. Well guess what? Each day we were in office, we worked for you, the entire country. It was never about red States or blue States, always about the United States of America. I was reminded of that last month when I visited Gettysburg. 
Folks, you know what? When I went to Gettysburg to make that speech, Abraham Lincoln said a house divided cannot stand. Well, a nation divided cannot stand. I was reminded of that earlier this week. Ladies and gentlemen, you got to go to, IWillVote.com/FLA. Become FL. Return your ballot today. I never forgot what President Kennedy said about going to the moon. He said, “We’re going, you know why? Because we refuse to postpone.” Let’s not postpone and get out of the rain. God bless you all. Thank you."
14,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-drive-in-rally-speech-transcript-broward-county-fl-october-29,"Joe Biden Drive-in Rally Speech Transcript Broward County, FL October 29","Thank you all so much for being here. I tell you what, I do miss the opportunity to just wander in and shake hands with all of you. But we decided a while ago that we were going to try to be responsible and not be… I won’t get into it, but just be responsible. And so thank you for wearing your mask and thank you for the social distancing. And thank you for being here. Ladies and gentlemen, Manny and Patricia, I want to thank you so much for being here today, for sharing your memory of Joaquin. Folks, I know what it means to lose a child and many of you do as well. And no matter how often, no matter how long ago it occurred, every time you stand up and you want to talk about your son or daughter that you lost, it brings back the memories as if it happened 10 minutes ago. It takes a lot of courage to stand up and talk. 
And you feel like you have a black hole’s been ripped in the middle of your chest and you’re being sucked into it. But through your courage and the courage of the Parkland families, like my friend Corey Hixon and his mom Debbie and brother Tom who are here today and other students who led the march for our lives to take on the NRA and win. We’re going to help us all turn tragedy into purpose. I want to thank you for your bravery, thank you for your resolve. I want to thank all the speakers that went ahead of me, including the NBA stars joining us today. I tell you what, the Miami Heat. You ever heard of the Miami Heat, I guess? Well, I’m allowed to say nice things about the Miami Heat even though I come from Sixers country. I apologize for that. 
But I want to tell you, they made it to the finals full of grit and toughness. And Karl-Anthony Towns, Karl, he knows what it’s like to deal with this coronavirus. Karl and his dad lost their mom and wife back in April. And a lot of these families didn’t have to lose anybody. And, thank you very much for being here. As well as my friends, Congressman Ted Deutch, thank you for the passport, Ted, into your district. I appreciate it. And my friend, Debbie Wasserman Schultz. We got to send the votes back to the House of Representatives. We’re going to increase the numbers in the House of Representatives. Five days left folks. Millions of Americans are already voting, millions more are going to vote by the end of this week. And I believe when you use your power, the power to vote, you’re going to change the course of this country for generations to come, at home and abroad. 
This election is the most important one you’ve ever voted in. Whether it’s your first or tenth. Ladies and gentlemen, the heart and soul of this country is at stake right here in Florida. It’s up to you. You hold the key. If Florida goes blue, it’s over. It’s over. Look, the press has heard me say this a long time, Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country. People standing out here in your automobiles, you are the ones that built this country. The middle class built this country, and you just built the middle class. You’re the ones who are going to save the country now that you built it. In these final days, keep that sense of empowerment with you. That sense of optimism of what we can do, what we will overcome. I’ve never been more optimistic about America or the American people that am today. And on November the third, we’re going to unite this country and show the world who we really are. 
I know it’s hard. All these past few months have been so much pain, so much suffering. So much loss. Over 225,000 dead Americans because of the negligence and the consequence of COVID. More than 16,000 here in Florida alone. As I said in April, Karl-Anthony, he lost his mom. Millions of people out there are out of work, on the edge, can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel and Donald Trump has given up. Over the weekend, his White House chief of staff said, and I quote, “We’re not going to control this pandemic.” In the debate last week with Donald Trump, he said, “We’re rounding the corner. It’s going away. We’re learning how to live with it.” No, he expects us to learn how to die with it. That’s what I told him. He’s doing nothing. We’re learning to die with it and Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to the virus. But the American people don’t give up. 
We don’t give in and we surely don’t cower and nor will I under any circumstance. President Trump’s super spreader events that he’s spreading more virus around the country. And here in Florida today, he’s spreading division in addition, division and discord. We need a president who is going to bring us together, not pull us apart. I’ll put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly. I’ve already done it and bring this country together around testing and tracing and masking. It’s estimated by the leading doctors in America, including Trump’s own director of the CDC and Dr. Fauci, they called for a mask mandate last week. If we just wore a mask over the next few months, we could save 100,000 projected deaths. 100,000 lives. We’re expected to lose another 200,000 people between now and the end of this year if we do nothing. This is not a political statement, it’s a patriotic duty for God’s sake. But still Trump refused to listen to the science. 
And we shouldn’t be politicizing the race for a vaccine either, we should be planning it safe and equitable and free distribution. Providing the funding for PPE, the mask and everything we need to protect ourselves. Setting a national standard for schools and businesses to reopen. Bringing together Republicans and Democrats to deliver the economic relief that’s already been passed in the House of Representatives for working families, the young employed, for schools, for businesses. Allowing you to stay in your home if you don’t have the money for rent. Allowing you to stay in your home. 20 million people are on the cliff of losing their home for next month’s mortgage payment. I’ve said it before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country, but I’m going to shut down the virus. 
Look, when Barack and I left office, we left Donald Trump a strong economy, stronger than the one he handled. And just like everything else he inherited, he blew it. Now he’s squandering that economy like he squandered everything else. But we can build back and we can build back better with an economy that begins to reward work, not wealth. We can do without raising taxes on a single person making less than 400,000 bucks a year. I promise you that. My word. But if you make $400,000 and above, you’re going to start paying your fair share. Ladies and gentlemen, all we’re going to ask is the wealthiest among us and the major corporations just began to pay their fair share. 91 of the Fortune 500 companies pay zero in taxes after making billions of dollars. They have to pay a minimum tax. Look, why should a firefighter, an educator, why should a nurse pay a higher tax rate than the super wealthy? Why should you pay more taxes than Donald Trump pays? 
And that’s a fact. $750. Remember what he said when that was raised a while ago, how he only pays… He said, “Because I’m smart. I know how to game the system.” He games the system at your expense. He games the system at the expense of hardworking American people. We’re going to deliver tax relief for working families in the middle class. We’re going to help people buy their first home, pay for their healthcare premiums. And for childcare, we’re going to care for the aging and loved one. We’re going to make sure you can wipe out your college debt as well. We give more help to race horses than we do college students. Look, Trump got the Supreme Court justice passed and he did it for one reason to try to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Again, since he got an office he’s been trying to, and the Republican and have been trying to multiple times, try to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 
If they get their way this time, 100 million Americans will lose their protection for preexisting conditions. If you have asthma, diabetes, any pre-existing condition, they can charge you so much you can’t afford anything. Including 8.4 million Floridians who have pre-existing conditions are now covered. Complications with COVID, heart scarring, lung scarring, heart disease, they’re going to become preexisting conditions. Allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, deny your coverage. And most people don’t remember it particularly the young people, women will once again be able to charged more for healthcare just because they’re a woman. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege, I think it’s a right of every American. 
If you all get out and vote, we’ll not only restore Obamacare, we’re going to strengthen it and build on it. The Biden plan is going to make sure if you have private insurance, you want to keep it, you can keep it. But you also have an option under my plan. To have a Medicare like option, a public option. We’re going to increase subsidies for lower premiums and deductibles, out of pocket spending. And we are going to reduce prescription drug crisis, the experts acknowledged, by 60%. Folks, we’re going to make sure we keep preconditions and protections for people with those conditions. We’re going to protect social security, Medicare. Meanwhile, the social security actuary says the plan that Trump says he wants to institute if he’s reelected would bankrupt security by the year 2023. Ladies and gentlemen, people paid that for their entire careers. Go home and tell that to your parents and grandparents. It will not happen on Biden’s watch. 
Folks, we need to vote for the legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change the world without being vicious and mean. She and Justice Scalia disagreed in everything, but they were friends. They disagreed. We got to get back to that. Politics has become so ugly and mean and disruptive, but we can be the voices for justice in her name. We have to make our voices heard. You have to vote. You have to vote because while Donald Trump fails to contain white supremacy, we can deliver on racial justice. Donald Trump, he doesn’t believe there’s any such thing as systemic racism as a problem. He won’t even say black lives matter. Well, you know what I know, black lives do matter and so do others. That’s why this season of protest is broken out all across the nation. Let me make it clear, protesting is not burning, it’s not looting, it’s not violence and must never be tolerated and it won’t. 
But these protestors are a cry for justice from communities that have long, long had the knee of injustice on their neck. The names George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, [inaudible 00:13:45] They’re not soon going to be forgotten, not by me, not by us and not by this country. We’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America, but true justice is also about economic justice, justice and education, housing, access to capital, good paying jobs. And by the way, it was long overdue time the minimum wage in America is $15 an hour. And by the way, my economic plan has been analyzed by the guys on Wall Street. You know what they say? They say my plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs. 7 million more than he’s going to be able to create if he got elected and a trillion dollars more in economic growth. What he’s forgotten, when you all do better, everybody does better, everybody does better. 
It’s not a zero sum game, it’s about financial stability and giving families of color a real shot to own a home, to start a business, to send a child to college debt free. So they can build the wealth, pass on opportunity down through generations. Is that how every white family that came from my background got it? They were able to get a house and build an equity, pass it on and grow it. That’s what we’re going to do. But we have to vote to ensure the full promise of this country. We have to vote for new Cuba policy as well. This administration approach isn’t working. Cuba’s no closer to freedom and democracy today than it was four years ago. In fact, there are more political prisoners and secret police are as brutal as ever. And Russia once again is a major presence in Havana. So much for his policy. President Trump can’t advance democracy and human rights for the Cuban people or the Venezuela people for that matter when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world. 
Started with Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un of North Korea. Trump is the worst possible standard bearer for democracy in places like Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea. For my entire career, I’ve stood for democracy and human rights. For freedom of the press, assembly, freedom of religion and against dictators, whether they’re left or right. Folks, it unconscionable that the Trump administration says it cares so much are deporting hundreds of Cubans and Venezuelans back to their dictatorships. Trump loves to talk, but he doesn’t care about Cuban and Venezuelan people. He won’t even grant temporary protective status for Venezuelans fleeing the oppressive regime of Maduro who I’ve met with and he’s a thug. Folks, I will, but we have to vote. And finally, we have to vote to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. This guy doesn’t understand much of anything. 
You’ve all seen the impact more than most. Devastating hurricanes that lay waste to whole communities. Economic toll is astounding. It grows every year and the human toll was worse. Lost lives, lost homes, small businesses shattered. First responders put at risk. When you talk about global warming, Donald Trump thinks hoax. Well, then he says we shouldn’t… By the way, do you know? This is a guy who is the stable genius. Remember, he’s the guy that said our problem with the Revolutionary War, we didn’t have enough airports. God’s truth. He’s also the guy when he talked about how many bad hurricanes are coming across the warm waters in the Atlantic from Africa, he said, “Maybe we should nuke them.” And also by the way, windmills cause cancer according to him. Look, what’s this guy talking about? But we know that we got to do something about it. 
Combating climate change means jobs. We can unleash the American ingenuity and manufacturing to build a stronger, more climate resistant nation, creating millions of new high paying jobs. And we can change the path we’re on, but we’ve got to act now. This country can’t afford to wait four more years of Donald Trump’s denial, who thinks the only responsible to the people who voted for him. I don’t see the presidency that way. I don’t see the presidency that way. In 2008 and 2012, Florida placed their trust in me at Barack and each day we’re in office, we worked as hard for you and the entire country as we did not red states, blue states, it was always the United States of America. Folks, I was reminded of that earlier this month when I visited the sacred grounds of Gettysburg. Abraham Lincoln taught us that we need to unite our nation, that a house divided cannot stand. 
And I was reminded of it earlier this week when I went to Warm Springs, Georgia. Reflecting on FDR taught us about the need to heal the nation. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of the president. A duty of caring, caring for everyone. And you to have a sacred duty, if I may say, and that’s to vote. It matters. Florida matters. In these final days stay empowered, stay optimistic, stay united. Make a plan and vote and help get out to vote. Visit iwillvote.com/fl. Return your ballot today if you haven’t done it so far, or you can get to vote early in person through November 1st. But you’ve got to get out and vote and make sure everyone you know votes as well. 
Folks, there’s nothing we cannot do from beating the NRA to restoring rationality and the climate. I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said when he promised to send us to the moon in his speech. He said, “We’re doing it because we refuse to postpone.” That’s what Americans do, refuse to postpone what is needed. I refuse to postpone my work america must do now. There’s nothing, this is not hyperbolely, there is nothing beyond the capacity of United States of America. There’s no limit to America’s future. We’re the only country in every crisis we’ve inherited, we’ve come out of it stronger than we went in it, because this is United States of America. And the only thing that can tear us apart is America itself. 
A president like Trump who appeals to our fears, president who pours gasoline in every flame he can find. Person who knows the only way he can win is if he divides us on race, nationality, national origin, gender. Look, everybody knows who Donald Trump is, we got to show them who we are. Article today in the press. I want to read a quote from. It says, “Never before in modern presidential politics has a candidate been so reliant on wide-scale efforts to depress the vote than Trump.” He knows if you vote, he can’t win. Why do you think they’re spending so much time keeping black folks and brown folks and poor folks from being able to vote? Why making it so hard? Because he knows when America votes, they reject people like him. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division and we choose science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. 
So folks, it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy. We can do this. We can be better than what we’ve been. We can be who we are at our best. As I said, the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I promise you. I promise you. And I promise you if you elect me, when I’m wrong I’ll acknowledge it. I’ll take responsibility, but I tell you what, I’m going to unite this country and we’re going to move like we haven’t in a long time. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
15,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-event-speech-transcript-fort-worth-texas-october-30,"Kamala Harris Campaign Event Speech Transcript Fort Worth, Texas October 30","What’s up Fort Worth? Can we please hear it for Rebecca Acuna? She is phenomenal. When I look at Rebecca, I know our future is bright. I know our future as a country is bright. She is extraordinary. She has been a leader in this campaign. She is someone who walks and talks with confidence, having life experiences and knowing when she walks in that room, yes, sister. Sometimes we may be the only one that looks like us walking in that room, having had the experiences that we’ve had, but the thing we all know is we never walk in those rooms alone. We are all in that room together. So proud of you. 
How’s everybody doing? It’s so good to see, Texas. Bernice, it is so good to see you. I want to first acknowledge all the leaders. Everybody here is the leader. Bishop [Spheres 00:00:07:47]. Where is Bishop Spheres? There? Hello, Bishop. Thank you for welcoming us in such a warm way. Thank you, Bishop. DeDe McGuire, I talked to her earlier. Where is she? Hi DeDe. Thank you. Thank you for your show and your voice. Fred Hayman and Marvin Sapp, where are they? Oh my God. I felt like that was a good revival. There we are. Thank you both for just the gift that you have and that you keep sharing and giving. Thank you. Eddie Bernice Johnson, the great Congresswoman. And Mark Veasey, We are on his home turf. Thank you for letting me be here. And Colin Allred, where is he? And Colin Allred. 
And we are all colleagues in the United States Congress. We are also members of the Congressional Black Caucus. And I will tell you Texas, you are so well-represented in the United States Congress with these three. And they’re always in these rooms. And you know, I see them in the rooms where the cameras are and where the cameras are not, and they are always fighting for the people of Texas. They are leaders for Texas and they are national leaders and they represent the voice of all people so well. So thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. 
So listen, today is the last day of early voting in Texas and you all have been doing your thing. What did I hear? Was it nine million people have voted so far? Early voting in Texas nine million. Now we know this is no time to let up on the pedal though, right? So I know people sent me pictures of standing in line at midnight this morning, I guess last night, waiting to vote. There was a line. People are committed. And so today is the last day of early voting in Texas. We want to make sure we see it through and then let’s make sure on election day, everybody we know has made sure that their voice, their powerful voice is represented in this election- 
Their powerful voice is represented in this election through their vote, because there is so much at stake and so many reasons to vote. Just think about it. Right now in our country, we are in the middle of at least four obvious crises, right? There’s the crisis that is a public health crisis that has caused over 215 … I think now over 220,000 people to die in just the last several months. The tragedy of it is so many, because of the nature of this pandemic, spent their last hours on earth without even the benefit of holding the hand and touching someone they love, maybe communicating through a video, but without the warmth of the family around them. 
Eight and a half million, almost nine million people have contracted this virus with untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. It will, by the way, at this point, most likely qualify as a pre-existing condition, which means on top of the numbers that we know, the disproportionate numbers in terms of African Americans and Latinos for high blood pressure and diabetes, we’re now looking at this. Let’s look at the racial disparities in this virus. African Americans and Latinos are three times as likely to contract the disease and twice as likely to die from it. 
The tragedy of the loss of human life, I’ve been referring to this as one of the greatest mass casualty events that we’ve experienced since World War II. The tragedy of it, and here’s why I bring it up, guys. It didn’t have to be this bad. It didn’t have to be this bad. Just think about it. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know about the seriousness of this virus. Informed that it is five times as likely to kill people as the flu, was informed that it would hurt people of every age. Was informed that it is airborne, and he sat on that information. He called it a hoax. He suggested that on his ledger of … the other side of his … ledger if you don’t. Can you imagine, as parents, as teachers, as small business owners, what you … President of the United States sat down, what you might’ve done to prepare, knowing that even before this pandemic, far too many Americans were working two and three jobs to try and pay their rent and put food on the table. By the way, and Joe Biden in my America, nobody should work more than one job to have to put food on the table and pay the rent. 
But what folks might’ve done to prepare, small business owners, workers, because you see, still, even before this pandemic, which has been highlighted, we have a country that has not made it a national priority for working people to have paid sick leave and paid family leave. That will change in a Biden and Harris administration. But what people … Their children are going to miss so much of these critical days … their education. What people might’ve done to prepare, to just simply buy a couple of extra rolls of toilet paper. We’re in the midst of a public health pandemic. You also have a situation where we have a President who, while we are seeing spikes around our country, talking about we’ve turned the corner, continuing to mislead the American people. So there are clear choices in this election. Barack Obama created Obamacare, which brought health care to over 20 million people and protected people with preexisting conditions and understood that healthcare and access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it, Joe Biden, who says we will expand on the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. We will extend protections. We will bring down the cost of prescription drugs. We will bring down the cost of the premiums. We will lower Medicare eligibility to age 60, expand healthcare, understanding the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It includes the neck up, and we need to expand mental healthcare. 
Clear choices, because you see, on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who together with his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court right now, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which, again, brought healthcare to so many people. Here in Texas, we’re looking at 10 million Texans who have preexisting conditions. If they are successful with that lawsuit, all of the folks who have … Over 20 million people are likely to lose their protections, and we now have almost nine million people who have new preexisting conditions called COVID. 
There are clear choices in this election. Because of this pandemic, the worsening of the wealth gap in America has been such that over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment insurance. We are seeing numbers that tell us one in five mothers who has a child under the age of 12 is describing her children as being hungry. Here in Texas, we’re looking at the numbers that tell us that one in eight households is describing their household as having been hungry. 
We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis in America. They’re not covering it enough. We’re in the middle of a hunger crisis. Here in Texas, one in six households has described not being able to pay their rent or being concerned that they cannot pay their rent next month. Here in Texas, one in four small businesses has gone out of business, and let’s be clear. Across America, almost 50% of the workforce either owns a small business or runs a small business. We are looking at an economic devastation that is being compared to the Great Depression. 
On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who says, ” You want to ask me about the economy and how it’s doing? Then you need to tell me how working people are doing. How are families doing in America?”, which is why Joe Biden is committed to not raising taxes ever on anyone making less than $400,000 a year, lowering middle class taxes, also making sure that no working family pays more than 7% of your income in childcare, making sure there’s a $15,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, understanding that is the way that we have intergenerational wealth in America, is to allow people to own a home. That’s how Joe Biden thinks of the economy. 
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when asked, “How’s the economy doing?,” he will ask, ” Well, how’s the stock market doing?” He asks, “How are rich people doing?” As one of his first orders of business, he passed a tax code benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you, Joe Biden and I, if we win, are about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people in America, invest that money in building back up our infrastructure, our roads, and our bridges and renewable energy, creating millions of jobs, investing that money in making sure that our students coming from families that make less than $125,000 go to public universities tuition-free, including HBCUs, including private HBCUs, ensuring that our students, when they graduate, if they take on a life of service and public service in a job that pays less than $125, 000, that their debt will be erased. 
… $125,000 that their debt will be erased. That’s how we’ll invest that money, in the American people. Crises. We are facing a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And there are clear choices. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is a student of American history and has the courage to speak the phrase Black Lives Matter. A Joe Biden who understands that we need to deal with these racial disparities, we need to acknowledge them, difficult though they may be to think about much less talk about. We need to address it in terms of what we’re doing around healthcare. We need to address it in terms of the racial wealth gap. We need to address it in terms of the gaps in our education system. 
Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it by putting $150 billion into low interest loans for minority businesses, Black and brown businesses which tend to be the economic lifeblood of the community. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with it in terms of a criminal justice system that must be held accountable for those disparities. Let’s get rid of mandatory minimums. Let us decriminalize marijuana and expunge the record of the people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. Let’s shut down the private prisons. Let’s get rid of cash bail, understanding people are sitting in jail for weeks, months, and years, simply because they can’t afford to get out, which makes it an economic justice issue as much as it is a criminal justice issue.” 
And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who on a debate stage two debates ago, refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down and said they should stand back and stand by. Donald Trump. Because you got to understand this is a pattern. Who, when running for office and even before, had the gall to question and challenge the legitimacy of America’s first Black president. The commander in chief of the United States who, when asked about the tragedy in Charlottesville, where peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice and a young woman was killed, and then on the other side there were Neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, hurling racial and anti-Semitic epithets. The commander in chief said there were fine people on both sides. A president of the United States who has called Mexicans rapists and criminals, who as his first order of business instituted a Muslim ban. 
America, we deserve better. That does not reflect who we are as our values and priorities as a nation that knows we are our strongest when we are unified, knows that we have so much more in common, regardless of where you live, the race, your ethnicity, the language your grandmother speaks. We know we have so much more in common. And we have a choice in this election to elect a Joe Biden who says we are, as a first order of priority, going to unify our country and bring us back together as a nation who values the importance of giving each other respect and dignity. Clear choices in this election. 
Not to mention the other crisis we are facing, which is the climate crisis. Texas, you know that well. You look at what’s going on around our country. Up and down the west coast, you know I’m from California, up and down the west coast, California to up to Washington over to Colorado, wildfires that are burning out whole communities. I’ve met families that are being evacuated or have been evacuated, never to return to their home. Firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. Tragedies. You look at the gulf coast states. The neighbor, our neighbors to Texas. Being battered by these storms. There have been now five named storms just this year. And they name a storm because it’s really bad. So Zeta being the last one, the most recent. In the Midwest, you’re seeing floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops. 
Joe Biden says, “We need to deal with this with a sense of urgency. We must embrace the science on this. We cannot play politics on this.” And we see that in this moment of opportunity to have timelines understanding, we must deal with this with a sense of urgency, that we also have the opportunity to grow our economy and create jobs. Joe sees the opportunity in the moment to invest in renewable energies, to invest in the apprenticeship programs with the folks like the building trades, knowing that we have a moment of opportunity to invest in America’s auto industry and be the best in the world in production of electric vehicles. All of these are opportunities to meet a moment of crisis if you are a real leader. 
And on the other hand, you have the current president of the United States who, when he was asked about the wildfires in California, so he was asked by a journalist, and the question was something like, “Well, Mr. President, these wildfires are happening and scientists are telling us there’s a real connection between the climate, the extreme changes, and human behaviors that are contributing to that. And what do you have to say?” The president of the United States who is also, again, the commander in chief, responded, “Science doesn’t know.” As though science is a person. Can you believe? Science doesn’t know? 
And there’s a through theme here too, because right? That’s how he’s been treating the coronavirus, right? A refusal to embrace the people who are smart enough to know what is actually going on and give us some direction around how we need to deal with it instead of trying to make everybody think everything’s okay as though people aren’t smart enough to see what is happening around them. So all these things are at play, and so much more. 
And that brings me to this moment where we are today. I’m here in Texas to thank you for all you have been doing to speak up about these challenges and to remind people to vote here on the last day of early voting, four days before the end of the election. And I’m here to talk about it in the context of also understanding that there’s a lot that we need to get done. And there are a lot of reasons for folks to vote. And people ask me a lot, “Why should I vote? Does it matter?” 
And I think there are three reasons that it is important that people vote. One is to honor the ancestors. Honor the ancestors. I mean, we, Bernice, Mark, we all know we lost an incredible American human, just a hero, in Congressman John Lewis. Just a hero. He is now among the ancestors. John Lewis, who shed his blood at Edmund Pettus Bridge. John Lewis, who said to us, ” Get in good trouble.” John Lewis, who lived life that was about a commitment to fighting for equal rights and civil rights. And it was a fight that was born out of being a patriot and loving our country, knowing the best way we achieve our ideals is to fight for those ideals, to do it in every way by standing up, showing up, and speaking up. So we must vote to honor the ancestors. 
So we must vote to honor the ancestors. This year, we celebrated the 19th Amendment, the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment. The ancestors, the suffragettes, who those hundred years ago in all of their white were marching and shouting for a woman’s right to vote saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be left behind.” Now let us remember, because we almost must speak truth about history, that black women couldn’t vote until 1965. So we have to remember that. 
But yes, it is important to honor those who fought for this precious right, understanding that like Coretta Scott King told us, the fight for civil rights, for equal rights, for human rights, this fight for justice must be fought and won with each generation. And what she meant is it precious, these rights, but you cannot take them for granted. We must be vigilant. So we vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. Let’s think about where we are. We talked about it in terms of these crises. I mean, let’s talk about it in terms of these 545 babies who right now have been orphaned because of a failure of the United States government to reunify them with their parents. Let’s talk about a nation under this administration that had a policy of separating children from their parents at the border. A nation that broke its promise to the Dreamers in terms of not following through on a commitment around DACA protections. There are so many things at stake, so that is a reason to vote. 
And the third reason is this. So I’m traveling the country and I’ve been to, in the last week and a half, in fact, I’m going back to Florida tomorrow, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Michigan. I mean you just name it. Okay? And one of the things that we have been seeing certainly since 2013, before for sure, but since 2013 when the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act, as we’ve been seeing as many as two dozen states putting in place laws through their state legislature that have been designed to suppress the vote, have been designed to make it difficult for people to vote. Have been done in such a way, you’ve seen that in Texas, where they’re trying to remove the drop boxes, where they’re trying to reduce the number of polls, where they’re saying if you vote from home, you need to fill out two envelopes. I mean, all kinds of things. Right? 
Leaders who have tried to make it difficult and confusing and to suggest you can’t trust the process. In fact, at that first debate, the President of the United States took that stage in front of 70 million Americans, and in my opinion, openly encouraged a suppression of the vote. Not to mention what he’s doing and what they’re doing to mess with the post office. The post office. The best people in the world work for the post office. The post office. 
So we have to ask, why do we think so many powerful people are going out of their way to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote? And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anyone ever take our power from us. Let us use the power of our strong voices every day, in the spirit of John Lewis, in the spirit of the suffragettes, in the spirit of all of the generations of people here and in the future who are counting on us to know what is at stake and to step up and to stand up and to fight for this country we love. That is what is before us. 
And so my final point is this. This moment will pass. It will pass. And years from now, our children and our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And you see, we’re going to be able to tell them so much more than just how we felt. We will tell them what we did. We will tell them what we did. 
We will tell them on this particular Friday afternoon, on the last day of early voting in Texas, we were sitting in a field, hanging out with Kamala. We will tell them we texted everybody, called everybody, emailed everybody we knew. That yes, we knew we were kind of getting on their nerves, but we also knew they’d get over it. That we reminded people of the path that we are on, that the shoulders upon which we stand, that we reminded people about what is at stake and that we reminded people about their power. 
And in this moment where we are dealing with crises we reminded our friends and our neighbors and our family that you are not alone. Don’t let anyone make you feel small. That you are big, you are strong, you have power. And at election time that power will be through your vote. And you will tell them when they ask that you elected Joe Biden, the President of the United States. Thank you Fort Worth, and God bless Texas."
16,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-tuscon-az-october-28,"Kamala Harris Campaign Speech Transcript Tucson, AZ October 28","Hey everybody. Can we please hear it for Mayor Romero? What an incredible leader. She’s a sign of strength and passion, and she represents who we are as a nation. Mayor Romero, thank you for everything you are and everything you do. It’s so good to be back in Arizona. You guys are going to make the difference. You will elect the next president and vice president of the United States. You will do that. 
I want to thank Pima Community College for hosting us. Chancellor Lee Lambert, Demion Clinco, the students, Congressmen Raúl Grijalva. There you are. Congresswoman Ann Kirkpatrick and the great Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly. Let’s get this done Tucson. And so here’s the thing, first of all, in the spirit of the late great John McCain, I was thinking, let’s start with a little straight talk. Now, there has been some talk about my values. Well, let me just tell you Tucson, I am a proud patriotic American. I love my country. And our values reflect the values of America. Our values tell us we have witnessed the worst, the biggest disaster of any presidential administration in the history of this country. Our values tell us that. 
Our values tell us that we should not be in a moment where over 225,000 people have died in our country. Over eight and a half million people have contracted a virus. When we got the information, we have known how serious this is. Listen, there is so much at stake in this election. And I’m just going to start by talking about a few of the things that we know. We as a nation are in the middle of four crises happening at once. We’re in the midst of a pandemic, a public health pandemic that, like I said, has caused over 225,000 Americans to die. People who many of whom died without any family members being able to be with them, to hold their hand, to look in their eyes because of the nature of this virus. Over eight and a half million Americans who now have a preexisting condition and untold longterm health consequences because of this virus. 
And the tragedy of it is this, it didn’t have to be this bad. It literally did not have to be this bad. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that on January 28th, Donald Trump was informed about the seriousness of this pandemic. He was told it will kill people. He was told it is five times more deadly than the flu. He was told it would hurt people of every age. He was told it was airborne. And he sat on that information. He did not tell you. Can you imagine, as a parent, as a small business owner, as a working person, if on January 28th you would have known what the president had known, what you might’ve been able to do to plan, to prepare. Knowing that even before this pandemic, it’s too many Americans working two and three jobs to pay the rent and put food on the table. Knowing that even before this pandemic, most Americans didn’t have more than $1000 life savings, what people might’ve been able to do to prepare. 
What you might’ve been able to do to prepare your children for the fact they may not be able to go back to school. What you might’ve been able to do if you run a small business to put in place provisions for the fact that you might be out of business for months. What you might’ve been able to do to buy some extra toilet paper. The American people were lied to by the president of the United States. And let’s be clear about something, the president of the United States is also the commander in chief, who has then as his highest responsibility to concern himself with the health and safety of the American people. And on that count, Donald Trump failed. He failed us. He failed the American people. And here’s the thing, Tucson you know this, there is a very clear choice in this election on this matter. Because you see, on the one hand you have a Joe Biden who is saying that we know access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. 
Joe Biden, who together with President Obama was responsible for creating the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million people who didn’t have it. Who said, “We will protect people with pre-existing conditions. Honk if you know anybody with diabetes. Honk if you know anybody with high blood pressure.” Honk if you know anyone with breast cancer. Joe said, “We will protect you. And the people you love.” Joe says, “If we win, we’re going to get in there and expand coverage. We’re going to bring down eligibility age from Medicare to age 60. We’re going to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and premiums.” Joe says that we understand when we’re talking about healthcare, you got to know the body doesn’t just start from the neck down it also requires healthcare from the neck up. 
So on the one hand you have Joe Biden, the choice before voters in six days. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who together with his boy, Bill BARR are in the United States Supreme Court right now suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act in the midst of a pandemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people over just the last several months. If they have their way, over 20 million people will lose coverage and the benefits for people with pre-existing conditions will be over. Let’s understand part of what the Affordable Care Act did is it said for women, free mammograms, for all people, free health screenings for cancer, and they want to get rid of that. There’s a very clear choice in this election, not to mention what they did to just ram through a Supreme Court justice because of their agenda to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. I voted no. 
It was an illegitimate process. And here’s the thing about where Donald Trump has been on the Affordable Care Act. I just have to say Raúl, we’ve been witnessing the same thing. From the time Donald Trump was running for office through the time he’s been in office, he’s had this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Have you all noticed that? Well, we don’t need presidents with weird obsessions. I think it’s time for that end. Do you agree? We’re in the midst of an economic crisis that is being compared to the Great Depression. Here in Arizona, one in 10 households are describing their family members as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. People aren’t covering that enough. I’ve seen numbers, one in five mothers is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry. Here in Arizona, one in seven households is having a difficult time paying rent or were unable to pay rent last month. 
Here in Arizona, one in four businesses has gone out of business. And on the one hand, you have Joe Biden who says, “You want to talk to me about how the economy is doing, well, then you need to tell me how are working people doing? How are working families doing?” Joe Biden who says, “You want to deal with the economy, then one, we will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. We will also cut taxes for middle-class working people. We will make sure that no working family pays more than 7% of their income in childcare. We will have a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers, understanding that is the way and access for most families to achieve economic health and wellbeing that is intergenerational.” That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump, when asked about how’s the economy doing, Donald Trump asked, “Well, how’s the stock market doing?” Donald Trump asked, “How are rich people doing?” Donald Trump as his first order of business passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America creating a $2 trillion deficit for all of us. Well, let me tell you something, when Joe and I are elected, we’re about to get rid of that and invest that money in you, the American people. We will put that money in an infrastructure plan that is about the creation of millions of jobs. We will put that money into an investment in renewable energy and what we know that will do that will not only save our planet, but create jobs. We will put that money to relieve student loan debt for any kid who is coming from a family who makes less than $125,000 and ensure they go to a four year college for free. 
That’s what Joe and I will do. We’re in the midst of a crisis, which is the long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. On that note, Joe Biden knows Americans’ history. He knows our history as a country and he has the courage to speak truth about it. Joe Biden has the ability to say black lives matter. Donald Trump will never speak those words. Joe Biden knows that we need to look at racial disparities in America. We need to understand Latinos and African-Americans have been three times more likely to contract COVID and twice as likely to die from it. Joe Biden knows our indigenous brothers and sisters have the highest rate of diabetes of any population in America. Joe Biden says, “Pay attention to this and understand a real leader will address the truth and speak the truth in a way that is about promoting equality and equity.” On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who was on that debate stage at the first debate and refused to condemn white supremacists. And then doubled down saying, “Stand back and stand by.” 
Donald Trump who has shown a pattern from the first days he was running and questioned the legitimacy of America’s first black president. Donald Trump, who when peaceful protesters were protesting racial injustice in Charlottesville where a young woman was killed. And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis wearing swastikas and carrying Tiki torches, spewing anti-Semitic and racial slurs. Donald Trump said, “There are fine people on each side.” He came into office talking about Mexicans as rapists and criminals. His first order of business was to pass a Muslim ban. There is a real choice in this election because you see Joe Biden and I understand America deserves so much more. We want a leader who is not about trying to sow hate and division. We know that the real strength of any human being is not based on who you beat down, it is based on who you lift up. 
And that’s the kind of leader Joe is. The crises we are facing, and I don’t have to tell Arizona, this includes a climate crisis. The West Coast has been burning. These wildfires. I’ve gone back. As you know, I’m from California. I’ve gone back. I have visited with families that have been evacuated, with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. I have seen the damage and destruction in our Gulf Coast states because of the storms that have wiped out entire communities. In the Midwest, farmers have lost whole seasons of crops because of the floods. Joe Biden says, “Let’s deal with this. Let’s face fact. Let’s embrace science. Let us do it with a sense of urgency and also understand we need to set time limits. Net zero emissions by 2050. We need to set goals that include in investment in renewable energies.” And guess what that’s about jobs, millions of jobs. 
On the other hand, you’ve got a Donald Trump who when asked about the wildfires, there was a reporter who asked him something like, scientists are telling us, science is telling us that there’s a connection between these extreme weather conditions and those wildfires. Will you address that? And the president of the United States in his utter eloquence says, “Science doesn’t know.” The president of the United States referred to sciences as a person. We need a president who embraces fact and speaks the truth to the American people and deals with what is one of the greatest threats to us as a species. So these are the threats and these are the crises that we are dealing with right now. These are just some of them. And it brings me to happening right now across America, a process that will end in six days and that’s this election. And what we know is that everything, everything is in each of our hands, in terms of the power we possess through our vote and our action to determine who will be the next president of the United States. 
And people ask, they say, “Well, does it matter if I vote? Why should I vote?” And I’ll tell you Tucson, I mentioned three things in response to that question. One, it’s important to vote to honor the ancestors. All those people who fought, who marched for our right to vote. We just, this year, lost the great John Lewis, a great American who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge together with so many others. John Lewis, who was such a fighter for civil rights, he understood the ongoing fight for civil rights. Not only did he shed blood fighting for African-Americans to vote in the South and around our country, it was John Lewis who was always at the front of the line saying, “And the civil rights fight is a fight for marriage equality. The civil rights fight is a fight for immigrant rights. The civil rights fight is for equity and fairness.” So it’s about honoring the ancestors. Those who sacrificed so much. It’s honoring the ancestors, knowing that we, this year, celebrated the passage of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. 
Right? And honoring those suffragettes who in their white were marching and fighting and saying, “We will not be deterred. We will not be silenced.” So honoring the ancestors. Reason number two, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. You go down the list, everything that impacts you and your family and your neighborhood and your community and our country. From healthcare to if we’re going to support working families and working people, understanding that it is that kind of approach that has built the middle class of America and made us strong when we’ve been strong. Everything is at stake. Whether we are going to have a country that embraces the fact that we are a nation built in large part by immigrants and we must create a pathway to citizenship and honor America’s promise to our dreamers and renew DACA. 
Everything is at stake. Whether we’re going to embrace science and deal with this change in climate. Whether we care about our standing in the world and whether we understand that the commander in chief of the United States of America should never take the word of a foreign dictator over the word of the American intelligence community. Everything is at stake. So we vote to honor the ancestors. We vote because we know everything is at stake, so much is at stake. And then here’s the third reason, I think, that it is important for folks to vote. And it is this. So I’ve been traveling all over. I’ve been in Florida and Michigan and Ohio and Georgia and North Carolina. I was in Nevada yesterday. I’m here in Arizona today. I’m going to head to Texas. Been all over. And here’s the thing. We have a long history of powerful folks trying to make it difficult for other folks to vote. And then in 2013, of course, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act and right after that, there were a couple of dozen states that put in place laws that made it difficult. 
Laws that were purging the voter rolls. And we have people in powerful positions now, including the president of United States at that first debate who took the stage in front of 70 million Americans and openly encouraged suppression of the vote. People who are trying to make it confusing. You got to fill out this envelope and put it in that envelope. Places where you got to have then a perfect stranger signed or somebody else sign your envelope. Places in our country that are pulling away drop boxes to make it difficult or shutting down polling sites. And we have to ask, why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote? Why are they trying to confuse us? Why is the president messing with the post office? And here’s the answer, because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so let’s not ever let anyone take our power from us. 
Ours is the power to use our voices. And at election time, that means our vote. And let’s not let anyone take it from us. Because here’s the thing, our democracy is always going to be as strong as our willingness to fight for it. And so that is what we will do. And that means every one of us voting, talking to our friends, letting them know what’s at stake. And then Tucson, my final point is this, this moment will pass. This moment will pass. And years from now, our children, our grandchildren, others, they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” They’ll look at us in our eyes, where were you at that moment? They’ll ask us. And what we will tell them is so much more than just how we felt. What we are going to tell them is what we did. What we did. We are going to tell them how we were hanging out this one afternoon at Pima Community College. We are going to tell them that we organized folks, that we let our neighbors and our friends and our coworkers and our family know what’s at stake. 
We reminded them of the sacrifices of the ancestors. We told them about their power. We said, “Yes. We have been in a pandemic where there’s a bit of isolation going on, but you are not alone.” We reminded them, you are not alone. You reminded them, don’t let anyone ever make you feel small. Know your power. That is what we will tell them we did. We will tell them, we knew we were a community. We knew that the strength of our nation is based on our unity. We will tell them, we fought knowing that we all, regardless of where we live, our race, our gender, our age, the language our grandmother speaks. We will tell them that we knew we have so much more in common than what separates us and we would not let anyone divide us as a nation. We would not let anyone break our confidence and our strength and our humanity and our commitment to our democracy. That is what we will tell them. And we will tell them and that’s how we elected Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. Thank you, Tucson. Thank you."
17,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-speech-on-the-affordable-care-act-transcript-october-28,Joe Biden Speech on the Affordable Care Act Transcript October 28,"Good afternoon, everyone. Let me say to the press assembled, I’m going to make a short statement here, and then I’m going over to vote with my wife and then I’ll be happy to take your questions after I vote. Okay? 
I just completed in here another public health briefing with my team of public health experts. We looked at the latest reported data on how it indicates that we’re on an upward slope of a bigger wave of confirmed infections than anything we experienced to date. We talked about what actions would be needed to turn this around and how it will be made worse by this administration’s declaration of surrender to the virus. And we discussed again, the vital importance of wearing masks, of protecting yourself, protecting your neighbor, and to save around a 100,000 lives in the months ahead between now and just after the first of the year. This is not political, it’s patriotic. Wearing a mask, wear one, period. 
We focused on the way this virus is hitting communities of color much harder, particularly black, Latino and Native American communities. We’re seeing race-based disparities across the aspects of this virus, higher infection rates, but lower access to testing and harder time quarantining safely because of their financial circumstances. Lower access to quality treatment, when they are infected and tragically higher mortality rates. One in 1,000 black Americans have died from this virus. This is a staggering statistic and 57% of black adults, 46% of Latino adults know someone who has died or been hospitalized from disease. 
Folks, we’ve lost more than 220,000 lives to this virus already. But this administration has just given up. Over the weekend, the White House, chief of staff Mark Meadows, went on television and admitted that they’ve waived the white flag and declared surrender. He said quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” End of quote. The American people deserve so much better than this. Just look at what happened last night in Omaha, after the Trump rally ended. Hundreds of people, including older Americans and children were stranded in sub-zero freezing temperatures for hours. Several folks ended up in the hospital. It’s an image that captures President Trump’s whole approach to this crisis. He takes a lot of big pronouncements and he makes a lot of big pronouncements, but they don’t hold up. 
He gets his photo op and then he gets out. He leaves everyone else to suffer the consequences of his failure to make a responsible plan. It seems like he just doesn’t care much about it. And the longer he’s in charge, the more reckless he gets, it’s enough. It’s time to change. Meanwhile, yesterday, the White House science office and this stunned me, put out a statement listing ending the COVID-19 pandemic as a top accomplishment of President Trump’s first term. Top accomplishment of Trump’s first term. At the very moment when infection rates are going up in almost every state in our union, the refusal of the Trump administration to recognize the reality we’re living through at a time when almost a 1,000 Americans a day are dying. Every single day is an insult to every single person suffering from COVID-19 and every family who’s lost a loved one. There’s nothing more personal. There’s nothing more personal to an American family than their health care and the health care of their loved ones. 
I know all too well what it feels like to have your heart ripped out, losing a loved one too soon. To sit in the hospital bedside and feel like there’s a black hole in the middle of your chest, knowing there’s not much you can do. I and many of you know what it feels like to watch a beloved person die, why they’re dying of cancer or some other disease without having to wonder about whether you’re can pay for the medical bills or what would happen if God forbid the insurance companies were able to come in and say, ” We’re not going to cover the treatment.” And yet today, President Trump is on a single-minded crusade to strip Americans of their health care. That would only create another enormous crisis in the public health system. 
In two short weeks, exactly one week after the election, the Trump administration will make its case, asking the Supreme Court to strike down the Affordable Care Act quote, “In its entirety.” In its entirety. Let me say that again. They’re arguing that the entire law must fall, which would strip 20 million Americans have their health insurance overnight, rip away protections for pre-existing conditions for more than 100 million people in the middle of an upswing of a pandemic, the upswing. 
Look, just this week on 60 Minutes, we heard what Trump told Lesley Stahl about the upcoming Supreme Court case on the Affordable Care Act. And I quote, “I hope that they end it’ll be so good if they end it.” End of quote. There is no question. There’s no question. That’s why President Trump nominated Justice Barrett to the court. And that’s why the Republicans jammed her through confirmation in the middle of the election. Republicans have tried and tried and tried since the Affordable Care Act was passed to overturn it. And every single time they failed. 
President Trump has tried everything he can on his own to sabotage the law. So now through what I’d characterize as a craving abusive of political power. They’ve added to the Court of Justice who criticized Chief Justice, Roberts’ previous decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act in hopes that they can destroy the Affordable Care Act once and for all through the courts. No matter how many Americans they hurt in the process. So let’s remember exactly what’s at stake in this election. If you have diabetes, asthma, cancer, or even complications from COVID-19, you’re going to lose the protection this law provides. Insurers will once more be able to jack-up your premiums or deny your coverage. Women could again be charged more for their health care just because they’re women and children will no longer be able to stay in their parents’ insurance policies until age 26. 
On top of all that, overturning the ACA could mean that people have to pay to get COVID-19 vaccine once it’s available. That’s right. That’s right. The law that says insurers are required to cover vaccines for free is the Affordable Care Act. And he’s striking that down, attempting to. Unlike Donald Trump, I believe health care isn’t a privilege, it’s a right that everyone have access to it? This country can’t afford four more years of a president who thinks he’s only responsible for the wellbeing of the people who voted for him. We can’t afford four more years of a president who instead of fighting the virus, attacks doctors. I can’t get over the guy. He attacked doctors claiming their over-reporting COVID cases because they want to make more money. Doctors are over-reporting cases because they want to make money. 
Our doctors and nurses and our frontline health care workers are putting themselves at enormous risk every day. More than a 1,000 of them have already died in attempt to beat back this pandemic and save lives. They deserve to be treated with respect by their president. We can’t afford four more years of a president who’d rather spend his time desperately trying to strip people of their health care, and even once bothered to put forward a health care plan on his own. We can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump. And the good news is we have a chance to turn this around by voting. We have six more days left in this election and the American people have it in their hands to put this country in a vastly different path. 
This is my commitment to you. I’ll protect and build on the Affordable Care Act, so that you can keep your private insurance or choose a Medicare like option. You can make it stronger. I’m going to make it stronger with your help to lower premiums and deductibles. And out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll bring down drug prices, but almost two thirds by taking steps such as allowing Medicare to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies who are making billions of dollars, making the price lower. When they negotiate, Medicare says, “We’re only going to pay you X amount for the following medicines.” That will lower prices drastically making it available to everyone. 
We’re going to make sure every American has access to free COVID-19 vaccine. This isn’t beyond our capacity. Now, if we come together, we can stand together. If we stand together as the United States, the United States, Democrats, Republicans and independents. We can transcend all divisions and show what’s possible. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to America’s future. And if I’m elected president, as I said yesterday in Warm Springs, Georgia. I’ll be a president who is not in it for himself, but for others. A president of doesn’t divide us, but unites us. A president who appeals not to the worst in us, but to the best in us and a president who looks not to settle scores, but to find solutions. A president guided not by wishful thinking, but by science, reason and facts. 
Even if I win, it’s going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic. I’m not running on the false promise of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch. But what I can promise you is this, we will start on day one doing the right things. We’ll let science drive our decisions. We will deal honestly with the American people and we will never, ever, ever quit. That’s how we’ll shut down this virus. So we can get back to our lives, a lot more quickly than the pace we’re going at now. I’m going to fight to protect your health care, I promise you. Just like I fight for my own family. We can do this. I promise you, and I’m going to go do what I hope all of you do. 
I’m going to walk out of this building and I’m going to go vote. I’m going to go vote. There’s a lot of people on that ballot, not just me, but the down-ballot as well, that are going to change things for us. Make it better. So may God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you."
18,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-las-vegas-nv-october-27,"Kamala Harris Campaign Speech Transcript Las Vegas, NV October 27","What’s up, Nevada? Steven Horsford, Jacky Rosen, Catherine Cortez Masto. What’s up Nevada? It’s so good to be back. It is so good to be back. You are going to decide who’s going to be the next president of the United States. You will decide. A path to the White House runs right through this field. And we’re going to get this done. We’re going to get this done. Seven days to go. Seven days before the end of this election. And you all have been doing your thing. I’m telling you. 
I was talking to Jacky backstage. I mean, you’ve been organizing, you’ve been registering people to vote before now. You’ve been reminding people about early voting, which is over on Friday, October 30th. You’ve been telling people about what’s at stake. You all have been, as you always are leaders and fighters for the best of who we can be as a country. And I am just here to thank you. I am here to thank you, Nevada. And there’s so much at stake. There’s so much at stake. 
Just think about it. We’re right now in the midst of four crises happening all at once, right? Two caused by the pandemic, a public health crisis and an economic crisis. And I don’t need to tell Nevada how hard folks have been to hit. A public health crisis where over 225,000 Americans have died in just the last several months, many without the benefit of having family and loved ones next to them for their last moments on earth because of the nature of this. Over eight and a half million people have contracted COVID with untold long-term health consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring, things like that, right? 
And here’s the thing. Thanks to a fellow by the name of Bob Woodward, we know that Donald Trump knew about this on January 28th. He knew. He knew it was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew it could impact people of every generation, including young people. He knew it was airborne. And yet he held onto that information and covered it up. He told the American people it was a hoax. The Commander in Chief of the United States has as their first responsibility to concern themselves with the health and safety of the American people and he failed and therefore has forfeit his right to reelection. And we are here to vote and make sure everyone does. That’s right. 
But let’s just think about this. So, this pandemic has hurt so many people and we have a president of the United States who suggested that you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask and on another side of his ledger, if you don’t. We have a president of United States when the last debate with Joe, did you see that? Joe just did his thing. Joe did his thing. And the president had the nerve to say, “We’re rounding the corner.” Meanwhile, here in Nevada, one in seven families is describing members of their household as being hungry. Here in Nevada, one in seven households is describing a difficulty paying the rent if they were able to pay it at all last month. One in four small businesses is out of business and he said, “We’re rounding the corner.” Come on, man. Come on, man. That’s a Joe Biden term. Come on, man. 
A public health crisis and in the midst of this pandemic, on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying, “We will expand the Affordable Care Act,” which he and president Obama created, which brought health care to over 20 million people. Joe Biden is saying, “We will continue to protect people with preexisting conditions.” How many of us know somebody who has diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus? And Joe Biden is saying, “You will continue to be protected.” Joe Biden is saying that, “We know we also need to bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60.” Joe Biden is saying, “Let’s bring down prescription drug costs. Let’s lower premiums.” Joe Biden knows that when we’re talking about healthcare, the body doesn’t just start from the neck up. We also need to address health care from the neck up and not just the neck down. That’s called mental health care. 
On the one hand you have Joe Biden and the voters have a clear contrast. Because on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who right now with his boy, Bill Barr is in the United States Supreme court, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And it’s an interesting thing that we have all observed. Ever since Donald Trump started running for office, have you noticed how he has this weird obsession with getting rid of anything Barack Obama created? We don’t need presidents with weird obsessions, do we? No, we don’t want that. He’s trying to get rid of a policy that if he is successful will cause over 20 million people to lose their coverage in the midst of a pandemic, in the midst of a pandemic that has now classified an additional eight and a half million Americans with a preexisting condition called COVID. If there is no other reason to elect him out of office, that is one. 
We are in the middle of crises because of the pandemic, an economic crisis that people are comparing to the Great Depression. Again, we look at the numbers here in Nevada. I was with the UNITE HERE workers earlier today. We look at all SCIU brothers and sisters, right? We look at all the working people who are struggling. We are in a moment where it has highlighted in many ways, this virus, in my opinion, it has been an accelerator meaning people who were doing badly before are doing even worse. It has now highlighted the fact that we have to get to an America where everyone has paid sick leave, paid family leave, paid to do their work, but also to have the benefits that any working person should have when we recognize the dignity of the work. But an economic crisis of proportions we have not seen. 
Again, a clear contrast because on the one hand you have Joe Biden who when asked about, “Well, how’s the economy doing? How do you measure how well the economy is doing?” Joe asks, “Well, tell me how working people are doing? How are working families doing?” Joe Biden says that we’re not going to raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000. And we are going to create a middle-class tax cut. And we’re going to make sure working families don’t pay more than 7% of their income and childcare. And we will make sure that first time home buyers have a $15,000 tax credit for down payment and closing costs, knowing that it’s the best way working people can have intergenerational wealth. 
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when you ask him how’s the economy doing, he wants to know what how’s the stock market doing. He cares about how rich people are doing. One of his first initiatives was to pass a tax code benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. There’s a clear contrast. Because in a Biden-Harris administration, we’re about to get rid of that and invest that money in working people, invest that money in building infrastructure, invest that money in what we know needs to happen to support the folks who have built the middle class of America. There’s a clear the contrast in this election, a public health crisis, an economic crisis, a long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. 
And on the one hand, you have a Joe Biden who is a student of American history. He is a truth-teller and he has the courage to speak the phrase, black lives matter. Joe Biden has the courage to speak the truth that there are racial disparities that spanned our health care system to our economy, to our educational systems and we must speak truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be to hear so that we can fight not only free quality, but for equity. Joe understands that. He understands we need to have a criminal justice system that is true to that concept of equal justice under law. And it needs to be reformed to the point that we get rid of mandatory minimums, that we decriminalize marijuana, that we expunge the records of those who have been convicted for marijuana offenses, that we shut down private prisons, that we get rid of cash bail, because it is not only a criminal justice issue, it is an economic justice issue. 
Joe understands that. He understands on the issue of policing. We got to speak truth about it, and there needs to be consequence and accountability when anyone breaks the law, including a police officer. And so Joe says, “We will ensure that there will be a ban on choke holds and carotid holds because George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. Joe says we will have a national registry on police officers who break the law so they can’t get fired in one place and then pick up and move to another place to get hired. Joe understands this things. On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who remember at the debate before last was given an opportunity in front of 70 million Americans to condemn white supremacists, but refused to do that and then doubled down and said, “Stand back and stand by.” And it wasn’t like, this was just a one off. 
Remember this is the guy who started running for office questioning the legitimacy of the first black president of the United States. This is someone who on the issue of Charlottesville, where there were peaceful protestors, protesting racial injustice in America, and a young woman was killed that day. And on the other side, there were a group of neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, spewing, racial epithets, antisemitic epithets. And then what did Donald Trump say? “There were fine people on each side.” This is a president of the United States who called Mexicans rapists and criminals. And one of his first acts after he got elected was to institute a Muslim ban. There’s a clear choice for America right now because you see Joe understands that we are better than this. Joe understands that it is enough. We’ve had enough with supposedly leaders trying to sow hate and division among us, trying to turn Americans against each other. 
Joe understands that the real measure of any one strength is measured not based on who you beat down, it’s measured based on who you lift up. There’s a real choice in this election. And we’re dealing with a climate crisis and I don’t need to tell Nevada, look, the West is burning. We know that. The West is burning these wildfires, I have gone to the site of the wildfires, I have met with the families who were evacuated, who lost everything they had. I have met with firefighters who were fighting fires while their own homes were burning. My brother-in-law’s a firefighter. I have seen, we have seen the destruction based on an extreme change in our climate. The Gulf Coast states battered by those storms. Midwestern states where farmers have lost a whole season of crops because of the floods. 
Joe Biden understands you need to deal with science. You need to understand this is representing an existential threat to who we are as a species. Joe Biden understands we need to deal with this with a sense of urgency because the clock is ticking on this, and also understands therefore, we need timelines, net zero emissions by 2050, we need timelines understanding with a sense of urgency we can deal with the crisis and also see the opportunity to create jobs and invest in infrastructure that is about renewable energy and good paying jobs and good paying union jobs. 
On the other hand, you have a Donald Trump who you all might’ve seen this [inaudible 00:16:21] I kid you not. So he’s asked about the wildfires in California, Jacky, he’s asked about the wildfires in California and Steven and the question came in kind of like, so the scientists are telling us about the extreme conditions and contributing to the wildfires and human behaviors are also contributing to the damage to our environment. And the president of the United States, the president of the United States responds with, “Science doesn’t know.” Now what is that? He’s the president of the United States. Well guess what, Mr. Trump science does know and you don’t. 
There is so much at stake in this election. And again, I’m here to thank you guys. Because look, I’m traveling around the country. I’ve been spending time all over in Florida, in North Carolina, was in Ohio and Michigan and here’s the thing… Georgia. I was in Georgia. The thing that you guys know is that all over our country, there are people trying to mess with the vote. Even the president of United States, as far as I’m concerned at that first debate stood on that debate stage and openly encouraged suppression of the vote. Right? 
And so when we think about this election, we know we have to be organized. We know we have to be motivated. We know we have to spread the word because there are so many reasons for us to vote. Now normally we always, we think of one or two, but I actually think of three reasons why everybody should vote. One is let’s honor the ancestors. Let’s honor the ancestors. We lost the great Congressman John Lewis this year, who was an extraordinary, extraordinary human being. John Lewis was a modern day hero. He shed blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right, for the right, for black people in America to vote. And John Lewis was a civil rights fighter. He knew an extension of that fight was his fight for marriage equality. He knew an extension of that fight was his fight for immigrants. He understood that. 
So let’s honor the ancestors, let’s honor the ancestors when this year we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. All those suffragettes in their white marching and shouting. Let’s honor the ancestors on that. All of us remember history and facts, black women couldn’t vote until 1965, but let’s honor the ancestors. That’s a reason to vote. Another reason to vote, everything is at stake. Everything is at stake. You can go down the list, everything we talked about, including is there going to be a president who cares about public education for our children and understands Betsy Devos is not the right way to go? A president cares about America’s standing in the world, understanding the difference between our allies and adversaries. Everything is at stake, and that is a reason to vote. 
And then the third reason to vote, I believe it’s this. So traveling around the country, ever since 2013 in particular, we can go back, but let’s go just as recently as 2013. The Supreme Court, the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act with a case called Shelby v. Holder. And when they took the teeth out of the Voting Rights Act and our ability to enforce accountability on states that had a history of discrimination, they took away that ability and almost immediately thereafter, as many as two dozen States started putting in place laws that were designed to suppress the vote, purging voter roles, making it difficult for people to vote, targeting African-Americans Latinos, students, our native brothers and sisters. 
And so much so that in North Carolina, the Court of Appeals said about the North Carolina law, that it was written with quote “surgical precision to prevent black folks in North Carolina from voting.” And we’ve seen it happen throughout this election, right? Where people are trying to make it difficult. You see, in like Texas, they were collecting the drop boxes. You see all over the country what they’ve been doing, right? Making people stand in line, shutting down some of the polling places, trying to confuse people. Even the president of the United States openly encouraging a suppression of the vote. Messing with the post office. I mean the post office. Like the best people in the world work for the post office? Messing with the post office? So on this point then I think it’s important to sit back and ask why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult and trying to confuse us about the integrity of the election system and our right to vote? Why are they doing that? 
And I think they know the answer and we certainly do. They know we’ve got the power. They know we’ve got the power. They know when we vote things change. They know when we vote, we win. So let us not let anybody ever take our power from us and at election time, the power of our voice is our vote. And so we, Nevada will do everything that is necessary to remind our neighbors and our family members and our friends and our coworkers, you’ve got the power and don’t let anyone take your power from you. The power is with the people. People, these journalists will ask, “Well, what do you think is going to happen the day after the election?” All that’s been going around, right? And here’s what I say. And here’s what I believe. America’s democracy is as strong as our willingness to fight for it. We are prepared to fight for our democracy and the integrity of our democracy. And we will not let anyone make us feel weak or insignificant because we know the power is with the people. 
And so that’s what all this is pretty much about. And over these next seven days, let’s continue to own our power. Let’s continue to run behind each other of our power because we have to deal with the reality that we’ve also been in a situation where you and I got to stand six feet apart and wear a mask. Can’t really see anybody’s face. People have been having to stay at home, not really see each other. And people are feeling alone and isolated. You got to deal with that. And so we’re going to have to make the special effort to not let it circumstances of this moment disempower anybody. Let’s let this moment be the moment that we rise to remind people of the strength of ourselves in each other. 
And my final point is this, this moment will pass, and years from now, our children, our grandchildren, others, they’re going to look in our eyes, each one of us, they’re going to look in our eyes and they will ask us, “Where were you? Where were you at that moment?” And what we’re going to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them we were hanging out on this particular afternoon in this field with Jacky Rosen and Steven Horsford and Kamala was on this stage, walking back and forth. We’re not tell them that we organized, that we emailed, that we called, that we texted everybody we know multiple times and we were okay if they got sick of us because we knew they’d come back around. We will tell them that we stood up and we fought for this country we love. And we will tell them we elected Joe Biden, the next president of the United States. 
Thank you, Nevada. Thank you."
19,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-transcript-atlanta-georgia-october-27,"Joe Biden Campaign Speech Transcript Atlanta, Georgia October 27","Thank you for that incredible introduction. My name is Joe Biden. I’m Jill Biden’s husband, and I am Kamala’s running mate. You all think I’m kidding, don’t you? Folks, it gives me so much more optimism about the future to see that Maya and so many inspiring young people like Maya… That’s President Trump. He’s having trouble being heard over there. They’re a very polite bunch. 
Look folks, I think Maya, you’re inspiring and so many young people like you I’ve met all across America are getting so deeply involved, helping create the change that you know is possible. And of course I know you’ve had an incredible role model in Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. I tell you what, she is something else. First of all, two things you got to know about her when you meet her. Number one, understand she’s smarter than you. That’s the first thing I had to learn. And the second thing is she’s got a backbone a ramrod, and she has a moral compass that’s true North. I really admire her. You’ve done an incredible job mayor. You’re a powerhouse of a leader and you’ve helped shape and support this campaign from the earliest days. So, I want to thank you, Mayor Bottoms, for your vision, your partnership, and your commitment to the campaign and the people of Atlanta. 
And thank you Common and Offset. I tell you what, I know that’s the real reason you came, the entertainment. I don’t blame you. But I tell you what, great to meet them both and for them energizing and sharing their message of hope with all of us. 
I also want to recognize the elected officials joining us today. Representative Billy Mitchell, representative Calvin Smyre, who have been with us from the very beginning of this campaign. And we got to send back to the United States House of Representatives, Lucy and Hank and Stanford. All three of them are first rate congresspersons because if I win I’m going to need them badly. And by the way, [Nikema 00:03:13], I think it’s important that you win as well along with Carolyn Bourdeaux. 
Folks, I think we’re going to surprise the living devil out of everybody this year. I can’t tell you how important it is that we flip the United States Senate. There’s no state more consequential than Georgia in that fight. You have two competitive races here at stake. You have two great candidates that are going to need all the support they can get. Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both great candidates. No, they really are. And by the way, if we had told you all a year ago or told those guys out in the street a year ago, good to see you man, told all those guys out in the street there a year ago, how competitive Georgia was going to be, you would have all looked at one another like you’re crazy. But look, it doesn’t take long for people to figure out when the game is up. When the Carney show goes through town the first time and people find out there’s no P under any one of the three shells, the next time it comes back, it doesn’t get much attention. Well, that’s what the Trump administration has done. 
Let’s give the people of Georgia to new senators who will fight for your interests, not for Donald Trump’s interest. And not continue as for doing others have to make fun of my running mate. I love how these guys try to degrade everything and everybody. It’s got to stop and it’s going to stop with us. Folks, it’s go time. There’s one week left. Millions of Americans, over 60 million Americans have all ready voted and millions more by the end of this week. I believe when you use your power, the power to vote will change the course of this country. Right here in Georgia, with all of you, these are the final days, so keep that sense of empowerment with you. That sense of optimism. What we can do. What we will do. What we can overcome. What we will overcome. 
Look folks, I’ve been around a while, but I’ve never been more optimistic about America or the American people than I am right today. But I know it’s hard. Over the past few months, there’s been so much pain, so much suffering, so much loss in America. More than 225,000 dead Americans because of COVID-19. 7,800 right here in Georgia. Millions of people are out of work on the edge. They can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. And Donald Trump has given up. Over the weekend, his chief of staff of the White House said, I quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” At the debate last week, Donald Trump looked at me and said, “We’re rounding the corner.” As my grandfather would say, “He’s rounding the bend.” 
He said, “It’s going to go away. We’re learning to live with it.” I told him, “We’re not learning to live with it if you’re asking people to learn to die with it. And it’s wrong.” Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families and surrendered to this virus. But the American people don’t give up. They don’t give in and surely they don’t cower and neither will I. I will put in place a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, bringing this country together with testing, tracing, masking. It’s estimated that if we wore masks the next few months, by his own experts in the CDC and other agencies, if we wore this mask the next few months, we’d save 100,000 lives. 100,000. 
It’s estimated we lost over 135,000 lives so far needlessly because he’s done virtually nothing. But still Donald Trump refuses to listen to science. We shouldn’t be politicizing this race for a vaccine. We should be planning for its safe and equitable and free distribution when it comes, and it will. Providing for funding for PP, masks, gloves, all the things we need to set national standards for our schools and our businesses to open safely because they can. The House of Representatives already voted the money to provide for safe opening of these schools, but Trump was either locked in his sand trap in his golf course or in the bunker in the White House. He’s not brought anybody together. 
Think about this all if you’re old enough. Can you think of any president where there’s been a national crisis who didn’t bring all the parties together in the White House to try to solve something? He’s done nothing. Nothing. Well, I’m going to bring Democrats and Republicans together to deliver the economic relief for families, schools, and businesses. I said before, I’m not going to shut down the economy. I’m not going to shut down the country. I’m going to shut down the virus. 
Look, Donald Trump crashed the economy that Barack and I left him. Like everything else he’s left and inherited, he squandered it. We can build back better with an economy that rewards work not wealth. We can do it without raising taxes on the middle class. I guarantee you, no matter what you hear this president lying about, no one making less than $400,000 a year will have one penny in taxes raised. Not one penny. It’s a guarantee. But we’re going to ask the wealthiest and the biggest corporations. 91 of the top corporate companies in America paid zero federal income tax. We’re going to ask them to begin to pay their fair share. No one will pay at a higher rate than they paid at the beginning of the Bush administration. That’s who will deliver tax relief for working families, the middle class, to help them buy their first home, help them pay for their healthcare premiums or childcare or caring for an aging loved one. 
Trump got a Supreme Court Justice, and you know why he did it, it’s clear to everybody now, to destroy the Affordable Care Act, to take away the healthcare for 20 million Americans who have it. And over 100,000, 100,000 who are covered because they have pre-existing conditions for the first time, including 340,000 Georgians. A hundred million Americans would lose their protections for preexisting conditions, including more than 4 million here in the State of Georgia. 
Complications from COVID-19 are going to become the next pre-existing condition because of heart scarring, lung scarring, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums, deny coverage and women will once again be able to be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re women. Donald Trump thinks healthcare is a privilege. I think it’s an American right. Look, if we all get out and vote, you’ll not only restore Obamacare, but we’ll strengthen it and build on it so you can keep your private insurance or choose a Medicare-like public option. We’ll increase subsidies and lower your premiums and deductions, out of pocket spending, reduce prescription costs by 60%. that’s to the experts are telling me, and they’ll tell you. We’re going to make sure we keep the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 
And by the way, I’ll protect Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, Donald Trump says if he’s reelected, he’s going to change how we fund it. Ladies and gentlemen, the actuary at Social Security said if he does what he’s proposing, if he’s reelected, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. Go home and tell your parents who work like hell for that, what that’s coming up. 
Donald Trump fails to condemn white supremacy. He doesn’t believe there’s systemic racism as a problem. And he won’t say Black Lives Matter because they do. We know they matter. That’s why a season of protests broken out all across the nation. Protesting though, is not burning and looting. Violence can never be a tactic or tolerated and it won’t. But much of it is a cry for justice from a community that long had the knees of injustice on their necks. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake, will not soon be forgotten. Not by me, not by us, not by this country. Folks, they’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. But true justice is also about jobs. Good paying jobs. The least as the mayor got done here, a $15 minimum wage and financial stability. We’re going to pass a national $15 an hour minimum wage. 
Nobody should have to work two jobs to be above the poverty level. It’s wrong. We’re going to change it. And by the way, when we do it, what all the experts will tell you, even the Wall Street types, we’re going to raise the economy, raise the standard of living for everybody. When folks at the bottom do better, everybody does better all the way up the ladder 
We’re going to give black and minority families are real shot to own a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt free so they can build wealth and pass on opportunity through the generations like everybody else who’s moved to the middle class has been able to do. We’re going to invest $70 billion in our HBCUs and minority serving institutions so students like Maya studied at Howard or students at Morehouse, Spelman, Clark Atlanta University. The future generations of proud students continue to get the very best education. And by the way, in the White House, I’ve committed, there is going to be in the outreach community, a section of The Divine Nine will be included. That’s a promise. 
I’ve been told that I kind of grew up with a little bit of a chip on my shoulder being an Irish Catholic kid in a town that kind of looked down on it. I tell you what, I didn’t realize I do, but I realized I do have a chip on my shoulder. When I read from serious people about eight months ago, something about how if I were elected president, I’d be the first president who didn’t go to an Ivy league school in a long time. Like somehow it meant I didn’t belong. I know Senator Harris will be the first HBCU graduate to serve as vice president. And I say it’s about time a graduate from a state university and a HBCU graduate are in the White House. Don’t tell me we can’t do it because if we’re sitting there, you will be there, too. I promise you. 
Folks, I’m optimistic because I know that we can meet the challenge of the climate crisis by unleashing American ingenuity and manufacturing to create millions of new high paying jobs, investing in technology and research. Folks, this is all in our capacity. We can do this. 
There aren’t a lot of pundits who would’ve guessed four years ago that a Democratic candidate for president of 2020 would be campaigning in Georgia on the final week of the election. Or that we’d have such competitive Senate races in Georgia, but we do because something’s happening here in Georgia and across America. People of different races, backgrounds, Democrats, Republicans, independents, they’re coming together to transcend the old divides and show it’s possible. And this is the most important election in any of your lifetimes. It’s a battle, as I said at the outset, for the soul of America, and we’re showing who we are. You and I, Reverend Warnock, Jon Ossoff, all of us. This country can’t afford four more years of Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell. They can’t afford four more years of leaders who think they’re only responsible for people who vote for them. 
Folks, I don’t see America that way. This has to change. It will change with me. Every American, including the guys on the other side of the fence, will be seen and heard and respected by me. If elected president, there will be no red states or blue states, there’ll only be the United States of America. I was reminded of that earlier this month when I went to the sacred grounds of Gettysburg. Abraham Lincoln taught us about the need of united nation. I was reminded of that earlier today when I was up in Warm Springs, reflecting on Franklin Roosevelt, taught us about the need to heal our nation. Folks, I’m running as a proud Democrat but I’ll govern as an American president to unite and to heal. 
I promise you, look at my whole career. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. That’s the job of a president. A duty to care for everyone. So in these final days, stay empowered, stay optimistic, stay united because you too have a sacred duty. The duty to vote. It matters. Georgia, it matters. So, please vote. Help get out the vote. Early in-person voting in Georgia goes through October 30th. If you’re voting by mail, return your ballot as soon as possible and make sure everyone you know does the same. Don’t just take yourself to the polls, bring your brother, your sister, your mom, your dad, your neighbor, your friends. Drop your ballot off in a ballot box. Visit IWillVote.com/GA to find the location in your community. 
And remember, remember the final words left to us by your late Congressman and my personal friend, an American hero, John Lewis. He said, “The vote is the most powerful, nonviolent change agent you have in a Democratic society.” He went on to say, “You must use it. It’s not guaranteed. You can lose it.” Use it. You have the power to win this election. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit on America’s future. The only thing that can tear America apart is America itself. No other nation can do it. Only America can tear America apart. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s show them who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction, and yes, truth over lies. So folks, it’s time to stand up and take back our democracy and any place, we can do it here in Georgia. We win Georgia, we win everything. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right. Thank you."
20,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-reno-nv-october-27,"Kamala Harris Campaign Speech Transcript Reno, NV October 27","Hi, guys. Hey, Reno. Hi, everybody. Oh, it’s so good to see you. Wasn’t Dominique amazing? Can we hear for Dominique? It’s so good to be back in Reno. I am so happy to see you guys, and what a beautiful day and look, I never knew there were blue pumpkins. This is fantastic. 
First, I just want to thank Patricia Ackerman, who of course is running for Congress in Nevada too. Let’s make sure we take care of that. And then of course Wendy Jauregui-Jackins, the candidate for State Senator in Nevada. Dr. Angie Taylor, Washoe County school district. And then Dominique. Okay. I’m just going to come over here. 
It’s so good to see you guys. It’s so good to be back in Reno and thank you all for coming out this afternoon. Everybody’s got a busy life, and these are tough days, and thank you all for the time, and for the energy, and for your commitment to fighting for our democracy. 
I’ve been doing it a lot of interviews, as you can imagine, and people say, “Well, what do you think is going to happen the day after the election?” You’ve heard all that talk. And I said, look, here’s what I truly believe. Yeah, we’ve taken a battering. There’s no question about it over these last three and a half years. If you think about our democracy as kind of a house, yeah, the shingles have fallen off a little bit, but the house is still standing. 
The house is still standing. And I’ll tell you why, because I do believe that our democracy will always be as strong as our willingness and preparedness fight for it. And fight we will, because look at what I’m looking at, and there are a bunch of folks over there, because we had to socially distance. So we got friends over there too. People are turning out. I’ve been going all over the country and these last like 10 days or so in particular, visiting with folks who were in early voting, and here in Nevada, early voting until Friday, October 30th. So let’s make sure everyone votes and vote early, just get it done, get it in. And I’m telling you guys, people are standing in line and the enthusiasm and the energy, and it’s because they know what you know, which is this is our country and we love our country and we’re prepared to fight for it. 
So that’s where we are. And look, I mean, there’s so much at stake in this election, I don’t have to tell you guys that. We are in the midst of at least four crises that are happening all at the same time. We’re a crisis that is caused by this pandemic, which has created a mass casualty event like we have not seen since World War II, where we are looking at over 225,000 Americans who just in the last several months have died. Many of whom were without a loved one next to them because of the nature of this, many of whom the family was hoping at least they could FaceTime, or see each other virtually for their last days on earth. People are mourning. 
Over eight and a half million people have contracted this virus, with unknown long-term consequences, including lung scarring, things of that nature. And the thing is, is that Donald Trump and Mike Pence, thanks to Bob Woodward, we know, knew back on January 28th that it is lethal, five times as deadly as the flu, that it could harm young people, that it is airborne, and they sat on that information and then had the gall, the President of the United States, the Commander-in-Chief, whose first order of business should always be to protect the health and safety of the American people, sat on that information and called it a hoax. 
Can you guys imagine if you had known, if parents had known, if small business owners had known, if teachers had known what the President knew on January 28th, what you might’ve done to prepare? Because let’s not forget, even before this pandemic folks were hurting. Even before this pandemic, folks were working two and three jobs to try and get through the month and pay the bills and in the America Joe Biden and I believe in, people should only have to work one job to pay the rent and put food on the table. 
People were hurting already. The average American family was struggling to have maybe a thousand dollars in savings. Can you imagine what folks might’ve done to prepare, not to mention buy toilet paper? And they sat on this information, and now in the midst of a public health pandemic, Donald Trump and his boy Bill Barr are in the United States Supreme Court, I voted no on that vote last night for confirmation, by the way. They’re in court right now suing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that brought health care to over 20 million Americans, that said people with pre-existing conditions should not be denied access to coverage. People who have diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus. Do you know over 1 million Nevadans have preexisting conditions? And they’re in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 
And it is a statement about who this person is, this President. Who in the midst of the kind of suffering we are seeing, has and is continuing with this very weird obsession he has had since he ran for President, to undo whatever Barack Obama created. It’s a weird obsession, by the way. We don’t need a President with weird obsessions. Let’s just move beyond that, that thing too. We’re in the midst of a public health crisis, we are in the midst of an economic crisis being compared to the Great Depression, where over 30 million Americans, in just the last several months, had to file for unemployment. Here in Nevada, one in seven families is describing their household as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. People aren’t talking enough about that. In fact, I saw numbers that one in five mothers is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry. 
In Nevada, we are looking at one in seven households who are finding it difficult, they don’t have the ability to pay rent. In Nevada, one in four small businesses has gone out of business, and it’s important to know that of the American workforce, almost half of the American workforce either runs a small business or works for a small business. The economic devastation is profound. And then when you listen to Donald Trump, even in the last debate, he’s talking about, “We’re rounding the corner.” What is he saying? Rounding the corner. When people are struggling to keep a roof over their head, but here’s the difference again, and the clear difference on all these issues. 
So on public health, Joe Biden is saying, let’s expand the Affordable Care Act that Barack Obama and I brought into being. Let’s bring down Medicare eligibility to age 60. Let’s recognize that we need to bring down the cost of premiums and drug prices. Let’s recognize that when we’re talking about healthcare, the body doesn’t just start from the neck down. It also requires health care from the neck up calling mental health care, and let’s expand that. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 
On the economy. Joe Biden says, you want to ask me about how the economy is doing, tell me how working people are doing. Tell me how working families are doing. Joe Biden says, we’re not going to increase taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year and we’re going to make sure that working families don’t pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. And yes, we are going to raise the minimum wage, but we also know that’s the minimum, and we need to invest in what we can do in terms of innovation, and building infrastructure, and investing in good union paying jobs to build up the middle class in America. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who when asked, “How’s the economy doing?” He asks, “Well, how’s the stock market doing? How are rich people doing?” 
He passes, as one of his first orders of business, a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations in America. Well, let me tell you something, Joe Biden and I are about to get rid of that, and invest that money in working people in America, put that money into building up their skills, put that money into supporting small businesses, so they can reopen and rehire. 
We’re in the midst of a long overdue reckoning on the issue of racial injustice in America. And on the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who knows, and has learned, and studied America’s history, and has therefore the courage to say black lives matter. A term Donald Trump will never use. Will never use. Joe Biden says, let’s deal with racial disparities. Let’s recognize that African-Americans and Latinos in our country are three times as likely to contract COVID, and twice as likely to die from it. Let us deal with the racial wealth gap where we know that black families own one 10th of the wealth of other families. Let’s deal with the racial disparities in our healthcare system. Understanding black women are three to four times likely to die in connection with childbirth than other women. That’s how Joe Biden thinks. 
Joe Biden says, we’re going to reform these systems, including the criminal justice system and in so doing, we will decriminalize marijuana and expunge the records of people who have been convicted for marijuana offenses. We will shut down private prisons because we understand the business model is there are some human beings making money off of the incarceration of other human beings. Joe Biden says, we need to reform policing to require accountability when a police officer breaks the law. And for that reason, we will one, ban choke holes and carotid holds, because George Floyd would be alive today, and we will require accountability around creating a national system of tracking those that have broken the law so they can’t get fired in one place and get hired in another. 
On the other hand, you have Donald Trump. Who, remember at the last debate, the one before this most recent one, refused to condemn a white supremacist group and then doubled down and said, “Stand back and stand by.” That on the heels of way back when, because there’s a pattern, of on the issue of Charlottesville, where Americans were peacefully protesting racial injustice, a young woman was killed at that. And on the other side, there were Neo Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying tiki torches, and he had the gall to say, “Fine people on both sides.” Has called Mexicans rapists and criminals. One of his first orders of business, a Muslim ban. 
And you see, this on this list, a very clear contrast is another of those issues before the American people. And on this issue before the American people is our ability to fight for a Joe Biden who understands that regardless of where you live, your race, your gender, your age, or the language your grandmother speaks, that we have so much more in common than what separates us, and it is time to end a supposed leader who is spending full time trying to sow hate and division among us. We want a unifier, and that’s why we want Joe Biden 
And on the list of crises, I don’t have to tell Reno, a climate crisis. You guys know it, you’re living it. We’re seeing wildfires throughout the West Coast. I have visited many of them. I have visited with the families who have had to be evacuated. I have visited with firefighters who are fighting fires while their own homes are burning. We see it on the Gulf Coast states, storms that are battering whole communities. In the Midwest, floods that have caused farmers to lose a whole season of crops. And Joe Biden says, look, we got to pay attention to science here and do it with a sense of urgency and put timelines in place because the clock is ticking on this. 
And Joe says, look, I also see the opportunity in the moment to save our planet, which is also will allow us, if we’re serious about it, to invest in infrastructure, invest in renewable energies, invest in the research and development that will allow us to save our planet, to save water, to save clean air and clean water. Joe sees that this is about building up the economy and jobs as much as anything. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who, okay, so he gets asked by some journalist about the wildfires, and the journalist asked him something like, “So the scientists are telling us these extreme weather conditions are causing this to happen. What do you have to say about that?” The President of the United States of America, who is also the Commander-in-Chief of the United States of America responds to that question by saying, “Science doesn’t know.” 
Mr. President, science knows. Science knows, and we know, and we know it is time that we deal with these issues and stop playing into the special interests that you’ve been courting since you came in office. So these are some of the issues that are before us right now, and there are clear choices. There are clear choices. And we have within our power, the ability to determine the future course of our country, we have it within our power. And you know, this brings me to the point in Nevada and why I will keep coming back. And Joe has, you guys know, it’s why you’re here. 
Nevada is going to help determine the outcome of this election. You are, you are, you are. And in that way, your vote is going to have an impact on people around the country, people you’ll never meet, people who may never know your name, but because you guys are so, so powerful in your leadership and engagement, you’re going to make the difference. And like I said, I’ve been traveling around the country, and one of the things that has become very clear to me is sometimes people say, “Okay, well, is my vote matter? Why should I vote?” 
And I think there’s three reasons. One is to honor the ancestors. This year we lost the great John Lewis who shed his blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge for the right for black Americans to vote, shed his blood. And the thing I loved about John Lewis, who I knew, and he was just an incredible, incredible friend. John always kept showing up there. On the subject of John Lewis, he was one of the first to show up and say, “Marriage equality is a core civil rights issue.” He was one of the first to say, “We need to deal with immigration and create a pathway and stop demonizing immigrants in America.” John Lewis. So he, and so many others, shed that blood. We should honor that sacrifice. This year, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment. 
All those bad-ass suffragettes, oh, there’s children here, but it’s okay. Mom said, it’s okay. All those suffragettes who marched, who couldn’t hear no, who fought for our right to vote. And let’s not remember because we must be true to history and the facts of it all, however, that black women were not able to vote until 1965. So let’s remember that, but honoring the ancestors, it’s an important reason to vote. 
Two, everything that’s at stake. And we went through the list, and there’s so much more. That vote last night, I voted against her for a number of reasons. One, because it has been an illegitimate process from the beginning. To push through and cram through a nomination of someone while the American people are voting, like literally we’re not even talking about election season or election year, tens of millions of people have voted. I think that the last number I saw was over 50 million people had voted when the confirmation went down last night, And the majority, by the way, of the American people are saying, “Let us choose who will be the next President of the United States and let that person choose who will fill a lifetime seat on the highest court in our land, that was previously occupied by the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” 
And there’s so much at stake. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we always should speak her name. What she did. I think of her as there was an inverse relationship between her size and her force. What she did for equality and women, and now there’s someone on the court who many of us opposed also, because we know she has a track record, which makes clear, she wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Now, keep in mind guys, in so doing, if they’re successful in getting rid of the Affordable Care Act, among the other things we talked about, over 20 million people access to health care, people with preexisting conditions being protected. You know what else will be at stake? Free birth control, free mammograms, free cancer screenings. All of that is at stake, not to mention a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. 
There’s so much at stake. So we honor the ancestors. We know what is at stake, and the here would be the third reason I think it’s important for us to remember the importance of voting. And it has to do with this: back in 2013, the United States Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in a case called Shelby V Holder. And they basically took the teeth out of it. And so what ended up happening is almost immediately thereafter, about two dozen states started putting in place laws that were designed to suppress the vote of African-Americans, people of color, students, indigenous folks, and so much so that in North Carolina, when the Court of Appeal reviewed what they did, said that that legislature had designed the law with “surgical precision” to make it difficult for black voters in North Carolina to vote. 
So my point here is this: I think it’s important to ask a question, which is why are so many powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote? Why are they trying to confuse us about voting? Why are they trying to suggest that we can’t trust the system? Why are they messing with the Post Office? My God, they’re messing with the post office. And one last ask, why are they going through such an effort? And here’s what I believe the answer is: they know our power. 
They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so let’s not ever let anyone take our power from us. It is our power to stand in those lines as long as necessary, we will bring our friends with us and have a good old time, but we know our power and we are prepared to exercise the power of our voice that comes with election time through our vote, because we know what is at stake, and we know the shoulders we stand upon that came generations before us, that would expect nothing less. 
And so my last point is this: years from now, because this moment will have passed, and years from now, our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look at us, they will look in our eyes, each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that moment?” And what we’re going to be able to tell them is so much more than just how we felt. We are going to tell them what we did. We are going to tell them we were hanging out this beautiful day in the amphitheater in Reno with Kamala and all the friends. 
We’re going to tell them we organized people. We’re going to tell them we texted, and we called, and we emailed everyone we knew repeatedly until they got sick of us, but we know they would come back to us eventually, but we did whatever was necessary to remind people of what is at stake, to remind them of their power, and to remind them that ours is a country worth fighting for, because we love this country. And so that’s what we are going to do Reno. 
And thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
21,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-transcript-warm-springs-ga-october-27,"Joe Biden Campaign Speech Transcript Warm Springs, GA October 27","Hello, hello, hello. What a magnificent setting. It’s hard, when you’re driving here, not to think of the circumstances President Roosevelt faced and how he overcame so much for so many. So, good afternoon. 
A few weeks ago, I spoke at Gettysburg about the need to unite our nation, and today I’m here at Warm Springs because I want to talk about how we’re going to heal our nation. Over these past few months, there’s been so much pain, and so much suffering, and so much loss in America. Over 225,000 people have lost their lives to a virus. Many of those lives lost the cruelest way possible: alone. Alone in a hospital room, alone in a nursing home, no family, no friends, no loved ones beside them in those final moments, and it haunts so many of the surviving families, families who were never given a chance to say goodbye. I, and many of you know, what loss feels like when you lose someone you love, you feel that deep black hole opening up on your chest and you feel like you’re being swallowed into it. 
The tragic truth of our time is that COVID has left a deep and lasting wound in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and we see the empty storefronts and the shuttered businesses, the visible signs of lost hopes and broken dreams. But what we don’t see is all those parents staring at the ceiling late at night wondering, how am I going to pay the mortgage? How am I going to pay for our rent? What are they going to do if one of my kids get sick, now that I’ve lost my health insurance. Growing up, like many of you, I watched my father struggle to find work. He made what I call the longest walk any parent can make, up a short flight of stairs to his children’s bedroom to tell a child you can’t play in that little league team anymore, you can’t go back to the same school. 
We can’t stay here, Joey. We can’t stay in Scranton anymore. We have to move. There are good jobs in Delaware. When I get one, I’ll come back for you, your sister, your brother, and your mom. It’s only 157 miles away, Joey. My father came home every weekend for that year or more, but he always said, when we finally got settled in Delaware, he used to say, “Joey, a job’s”, and all my friends would hear it as well, “A job’s about a lot more than a paycheck.” My sister heard it as well, Valerie. He said, “It’s about your dignity, a job. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” And right now, on this autumn afternoon, millions of Americans all across this country feel they’ve lost all that. 
A season of protest has broken out all across the nation. Some of it is just senseless burning and looting and violence that can’t be tolerated and won’t, but much of it is a cry for justice from a community that’s long had a knee of injustice on their neck. The names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Jacob Blake. They’ll not soon be forgotten, not by me, not by us, and not by this country. They’re going to inspire a new wave of justice in America. These are historic, painful crises. The insidious virus, the economic anguish, the systematic discrimination, and one of them could have rocked the nation, any one of them. Yet, we’ve been hit by all three at once. But if we’re honest with ourselves, the pain striking at the heart of our country goes back not months but years. Our politics for too long hae been mean and bitter and divisive, you can hear it now in the distance. We’ve stopped seeing dignity in one another. We’ve stopped showing each other respect. 
Too many among us spend more time shouting than listening, more time fighting than working together, more time demonizing and denigrating others than lifting them up. The divisions in our nation are getting wider. Angry people are upset, anger and suspicion are growing, and our wounds are getting deeper. It may, and many wonder, has it gone too far? Have we passed the point of no return? Has the heart of this nation turned to stone? I don’t think so. I refuse to believe it. I know this country, I know our people, and I know we can unite and heal this nation. Warm Springs is a good place to talk about hope and healing. So Franklin Roosevelt came, “To use the therapeutic waters to rebuild himself.” Stricken by polio, the polio virus in 1921, he suffered from paralysis. Like many other Americans in those pre-vaccine decades, FDR longed to live an independent life, a life that wasn’t defined by his illness. To him, and to so many others facing physical challenges, Warm Springs offered therapy for the body, and I might add, and the soul, but it offered something else as well. 
FDR came looking for a cure, but it was the lessons he learned here that he used to lift a nation. Humility, empathy, courage, optimism. This place represented a way forward. A way of restoration, of resilience, of healing. In the years that followed, FDR would come back to Warm Springs often to think about how to heal the nation and the world, and that’s exactly what he did. Lifting us out of a great depression, defeating tyranny, saving democracy. Then it was here on April 12th, 1945, that President Roosevelt died. A casualty of war as surely as any who fell in combat, and the free world mourned. American leaders wept. Maybe even more important was the reaction of the American people. Naval Chief Petty Officer Graham Jackson, a black man, cried as he played his accordion in tribute to FDR, not far from here. 
And the story is told that when Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s procession went by, a man collapsed in grief. The neighbor asked him, “Did you know the president?” The response was “No,” the man said, “but he knew me.” He knew me. Few words better describe the kind of president our nation needs right now. A President who is not in it for himself, but for others. A President who doesn’t divide us, but unites us. A President who appeals not to the worst in us, but to the best. A President who cares less about his TV ratings and more about the American people. A President who looks not to settle scores, but to find solutions. A President guided not by wishful thinking, but by science, reason, and fact. That’s the kind of President I hope to be. 
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as for those who do. That’s the job of a President, a duty of care for everyone. This place, Warm Springs, is a reminder that though broken, each of us can be healed. That as a people and a country, we can overcome this devastating virus. That we can heal a suffering world. And yes, we can restore our soul and save our country. 
In his last hours, President Roosevelt was at work on a speech to be delivered the next day. In it he was to say, “Today, we must cultivate the science of human relationships, the ability of all people, of all kinds, to live together and work together in the same world at peace.” To live together and work together. That’s how I see America. That’s how I see the presidency. And that’s how I see the future. I tell you this from my heart. I believe America and American hope, not fear. Unity, not division. Love, not hate. The presidency though, is only one part of the American chorus. History isn’t only a story of the great and the famous. No, our history is a story of we, the people, of all of us together. 
I’ve long said the story of America is a story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Change in our country comes when the voices of the powerless reach the ears of the powerful. When those whose names we’ll never know, but will risk their lives to, in the words of Dr. King, “Bend the arc of the moral universe towards justice.” Bending that arc is the work of our time, but it’ll take all of us. Red states, blue states, Republicans, Democrats, Conservatives, and Liberals. And I believe from the bottom of my heart, we can do it. 
People ask me, why are you so confident Joe? Because we are the United States of America. There’s nothing, nothing the American people can’t do and been unable to do if we put our minds to it. When news of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s death went out on the wires, an editor in Chicago, turned to his colleague and said “Clear the decks for action.” So I say to you today, if you’re giving me the honor of serving as your President, clear the decks for action. 
For we will act, we will act on the first day of my presidency to get COVID under control. We’ll act to pass my economic plan that will finally reward work, not wealth in this country. We’ll act to pass my health care plan to provide affordable, accessible healthcare for every American, and drug prices that are dramatically lowered. We’ll act to pass the Biden climate plan, meeting the challenges of a climate crisis while creating millions of good paying, high paying, labor jobs. We’ll act to address systemic racism in our country, and we’ll act to give working people a fair shot again in this country. And we’ll act to restore our faith in democracy and our faith in one another. 
Today, we’re facing a public health crisis of historic proportions. And with winter at hand, it’s getting worse. Just last Friday, 83,000 new cases in one day. Saturday, another 83,000 cases. Nearly 1000 people a day are dying. Another 200,000 deaths are expected over the next several months, and the President keeps telling us not to worry. He keeps telling us we’re turning the corner is his quote. He’s as removed from reality, and as offensive as when they told us the virus affects virtually nobody, just the elderly with heart conditions. Virtually nobody, just the elderly with heart conditions, as if they don’t matter. 
And when he said in response to the number of deaths reaching a thousand, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. In the spring, the President declared, in his voice as Commander-in-Chief, says Commander-in Chief. He was going to wage war on the virus. Instead he shrugged, he swaggered, and he surrendered. Then his Chief of Staff just last week made a stunning admission, an admission that I believe, but never thought he’d say. Saying, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” End of quote. We’re not going to control the pandemic. It’s a capitulation. It’s a waving of a white flag. It’s a window into the shocking truth about this White House that they’ve never really tried. 
Think about all the frontline health professionals who’ve risked and some given their lives for the last nine months in this pandemic. Think about all the first responders. Think about all the grocery store clerks, the drivers, the delivery drivers of the trucks, teachers, parents, the kids home from school. Think about all those who have lost their jobs. Think about all those have been infected by the virus. Think about all those who have died. They were giving their all while their President was giving up. Well, I’m here to tell you: we can, and we will control this virus. As President, I will never wave the white flag of surrender. Just imagine where we’d be today if the President had embraced wearing masks instead of mocking it. Imagine where we’d be today if the president had practiced social distancing, instead of holding super spreader events. Imagine where we’d be with a comprehensive system of testing and tracing. 
I first put forward a detailed plan on how to deal with this virus back in March, this administration ignored it. Then I released several more detailed plans in the months that followed, the most recent just last week. This administration has yet to offer a single plan. Yes, one of the reasons why the most one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world, the New England Journal of Medicine, called the President “Dangerously incompetent.” Went on to say, “The President turned a crisis into a tragedy.” 
I’m ready to act. I know what to do. Starting on day one of my presidency, we will do it. I’ve talked about the battle for the soul of America since the very beginning of this campaign, and I want to be very clear in these closing days about what I mean, and about what I intend to do in that battle. To assure that our better angels prevail over our worst instincts. I believe this election is about who we are as a nation, what we believe, and maybe most importantly, who we want to be. It’s about our essence. It’s about what makes us Americans. It’s that fundamental. Time and again, throughout our history, we’ve seen charlatans, the con men, the phony populist, who sought the play on our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain. 
They appear when the nation’s been hit the hardest and we’re at our most vulnerable, never to solve anything, but only the benefit themselves. In a recent encyclical, Pope Francis warns us against this phony populism, that appeals to “The basest and most selfish instincts.” He goes on to say, “Politics is something more noble than posturing, marketing, and media spin. These sow nothing but division, conflict, and a bleak cynicism.” He said, “For those who seek to lead, we do well to ask ourselves, why am I doing this? Why? What is my real aim?” Pope Francis asked questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation and to heal this nation. I’ve said that from the beginning. It is badly necessary. 
The Bible tells us there’s a time to break down, and a time to build up, a time to heal. This is that time. God and history have called us to this moment, and to this mission. With our voices and our votes, we must free ourselves from the forces of darkness, from the forces of division, and the forces of yesterday, and the forces that pull us apart, hold us down, and hold us back. And if we do so, we’ll once more become one nation under God, indivisible, a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed. That is my goal. That is why I’m running. That is what we must do. 
Thank you all for being here, and may God bless America, and may God protect our troops. Stay safe and wear your mask."
22,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/barack-obama-campaign-speech-for-joe-biden-transcript-orlando-october-27,Barack Obama Campaign Speech for Joe Biden Transcript Orlando October 27,"Hello, Orlando! 
Oh, this is a good looking crowd here! Thank you so much. Can everybody please give [Lorden 00:00:26] a big round of applause for that great introduction? What an outstanding young man. 
Now, it is good to be back here in Florida. I don’t know if we’ve got any Tampa Bay Rays fans here in Orlando? Big game tonight. It’s do-or-die time. Now, the last time the Rays were in the world series in 2008, Florida sent me to the White House. The Rays fell just a bit short then. But here in Florida, Democrats fell a little bit short in 2016 also. Over the next couple of weeks, Florida, you’ve got the chance to fix two mistakes. You’ve got the chance to set two things right. You can bring a World Series championship to the Sunshine State and you can send Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to the White House. We’ve got one week, Orlando. One week. 
[Spanish 00:01:36]. One week until the most important election of our lifetimes. You don’t have to wait until next Tuesday to cast your ballot, you’ve got two ways to vote right now. Number one, you can vote early in person right now. Number two, you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Don’t wait. Put it in the mail or drop it off at a drop-box location today. Don’t take any chances, just get it done. Just go to IWillVote.com to find out where you can early vote in person or drop off your ballot. How many of you have already voted? If you’ve already voted, then your job is to go help your friends and family make a plan to vote because this election requires every single one of us. What we do this week will matter for decades to come. 
Now I’ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who were running for president. Just in case you couldn’t tell, they’re very different people. I didn’t think that Donald Trump would embrace my vision or my policies, but I did hope for the country’s sake that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously. But he didn’t. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency as anything more than a reality show that can give him the attention that he craves, and he does crave attention. This week with everything that’s happening, you know what he brought up? He was fussing about the crowd size at the inauguration again, saying his was bigger. Who is thinking about that right now? Nobody accept him. But the rest of us have had to live with the consequences: More than 225,000 people in this country are dead, more than 100,000 small businesses have closed, half-a-million jobs are gone in Florida alone. Think about that. 
What’s his closing argument? That people are too focused on COVID. He said this at one of rallies. “COVID, COVID, COVID,” he’s complaining. He’s jealous of COVID’s media coverage. If he had been focused on COVID from the beginning, cases wouldn’t be reaching new record highs across the country this week. If we were focused on COVID now, the White House wouldn’t be having its second outbreak in a month. The White House. Let me say this, I lived in the White House for a while. It’s a controlled environment. You can take some preventative measures in the White House to avoid getting sick, except this guy can’t seem to do it. He’s turned the White House into a hot zone. Some of the places he holds rallies have seen new spikes right after he leaves town. And over the weekend, his chief of staff said, and I’m quoting here, I’m not making this up, his chief of staff on a news program says, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” He just said this. 
Yes, he did. And yes, we noticed you’re not going to control the pandemic. 
Listen, winter is coming. They’re waving the white flag of surrender. Florida, we can’t afford four more years of this. That’s why we’ve got to send Joe Biden to the White House, because we cannot afford this kind of incompetence and disinterest. 12 years ago when I chose a vice-president, I didn’t know Joe all that well. We served in the Senate together. I notice, by the way, one of my great friends, Ben Nelson. Bill Nelson. See, I haven’t seen Bill in a while, so that’s why. Plus, he’s wearing a mask. But one of the great senators from Florida, and Joe and I served together with him. I had a lot of friends in the Senate, but Joe and I wasn’t the closest person. But he and I came from different places, we came from different generations, but I quickly came to admire Joe as a man who learned early to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect. Bill will testify to this, Joe is somebody who lives by the words his parents taught him: “No one’s better than you, Joe, but you’re better than nobody.” He believes everybody counts. He believes everybody’s important. And that empathy, that decency, that belief in other people, that’s who Joe is, and that’s who he’ll be. 
I can tell you the presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. Joe, time and time again, has shown himself to be a man of principle and character and he’s going to be a great president. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room. Whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president, and he’s got the character and the experience to make us a better country. He and Kamala are going to be in the fight not for themselves but for every single one of us. 
Listen, you’ve got a president right now, he wants full credit for an economy that he inherited, he wants zero blame for the pandemic he ignored. But you know what? The job doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to be responsible 24/7. You’ve got to pay attention 24/7. Tweeting at the TV doesn’t fix things. Watching TV all day doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t fix things. You’ve got to have a plan if you want to make people’s lives better. You’ve got to put in the work if you want to make people’s lives better. Along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and he’s got concrete policies that will turn our vision of a better fairer, stronger country into a reality. 
Look, here’s the truth: The pandemic would have been challenging for any president, but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this thing up is nonsense. South Korea had its first case of COVID at the same time, the same week as the United States. Do you know that their per capita death rate is just 1.3% of what ours is? Think about that statistic. I’ve given this statistic a couple of times and people haven’t really focused on it. The number of people in Korea who have died of COVID per capita is less than 1.5%. What our death rate is. That’s thousands and thousands of people, if we had been as effective and responsible, whose lives would have been saved in this country. Just across the border in Canada, the death rate per capita is 39% what ours here is in the United States. We are the largest, the wealthiest, most powerful country on earth and we cannot somehow get a grip on this because our government hasn’t been doing its job. 
Last week when Trump was asked if he’d do anything differently, you know what he said? He said, “Not much. Not much.” Really? Not much? You can’t think of anything that you might be doing differently, like maybe you shouldn’t have gotten on TV and suggested we might inject bleach to cure COVID? That’s not something you said maybe I shouldn’t have said that? Not much. Think about how hard the tourism industry has been hit right here in Orlando, right here in Florida. You lost one spring training season already, and he can’t think of doing anything differently? 
Joe takes this seriously. He knows the emotional toll- 
He knows the emotional toll on grandparents when they can’t see and hug their grandkids. He’s not going to screw up testing. He’s not going to call scientists idiots. He’s not going to host super spreader events at the White House, and then take it on a tour all across the country. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available. He’s going to get a vaccine to every American cost-free, and he’s going to make sure our frontline heroes never have to ask other countries for the equipment that they need to keep themselves safe. His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic. He’s going to make sure that small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. 
And he understands that we’re not going to rebuild the economy and put people back to work until we get this pandemic under control. It’s not that complicated. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy, but I just want to remind you that America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump Pence administration. That’s a fact. Look it up. And that was before Trump could blame the pandemic. He, in fact, inherited the longest streak of job growth in American history. But just like everything else he inherited, he screwed it up. 
And the economic damage that he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs, first president since Herbert Hoover, back in the thirties. That’s a long time people. That’s almost a hundred years ago. He loves to talk about Black unemployment. Look how low Black unemployment … Well, you know what? Unemployment was really high when I came in, and we brought that unemployment low, and it kept on going low, and he wants to take credit for it. Says he’s the best president for Black folks since Abe Lincoln? Man! Now his advisors are out there saying, including his son-in-law. His son-in-law says Black folks have to want to be successful. That’s the problem. Who are these folks? What history books do they read? Who do they talk to? Don’t read? Is that what is going on? 
Black unemployment hit almost 17% during the great recession 10 years ago, and through a lot of hard work, Joe Biden and I helped get it down, and it kept on going down, not because Trump did anything. And then this year, because they screwed up the pandemic response, it’s soared back up to above 17% here in Florida. But it doesn’t have to be that way, Florida, if you go out and vote. 
Si se puede. Yes we can. Listen, the only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires that got Trump’s tax cuts. In the meantime, he has not been able to manage extending relief to millions of families who can’t pay the rent right now, can’t put food on the table right now. Got no plan to reopen schools that need reopening or protecting teachers in the process. I don’t understand how it is that he cannot organize Republicans in Congress to do the right thing. And it’s not like it’s his money that we’re asking him to pay because he doesn’t pay taxes. Barely pays income tax. 
We know he’s got a secret Chinese bank account, so he may be paying taxes to the Chinese, but he’s not paying taxes here. First year in the White House, only paid $750 in taxes, in federal income taxes. $750. Can you imagine that? I mean, teachers pay more than that. Social workers pay more than that in taxes. Huh? Soldiers. Folks in uniform pay more in taxes than that. So how are you living large, and you’re not willing to do the right thing to make sure that we’re able to pay for quality schools for our kids, to provide veterans benefits for those who’ve earned them. 
Joe Biden has a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs right here in America. It’s part of his plan to protect Florida from climate change and secure environmental justice, and he’s going to pay for it by rolling back those tax cuts to billionaires. And the thing is, Joe doesn’t just want to get back to where we were. He finally wants to make some long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody. The waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester’s classes, the shift worker who’s worried about maybe being laid off, the cancer survivor who’s worried that her preexisting conditions might prevent her from being able to get coverage. 
And speaking of healthcare, by the way, you may have noticed Republicans love saying right before an election how they’re going to protect people who have preexisting conditions. Have you noticed that? Well, you know what? Joe and I actually protected them 10 years ago with the Affordable Care Act. And you know those same Republicans who say they’re going to protect them, somehow they have tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 60 times. And each time they try to repeal it, they say, “Oh, we’ve got a great replacement. It’s coming.” Everybody’s a little young here, but you guys remember Popeye? And remember that guy who always needed to borrow some money for a hamburger? He said, “Don’t worry. I’m going to be paying you back sometime soon.” 
That’s like Republicans with healthcare. They always say, “It’s coming soon. We’re going to be paying you back with a great replacement plan.” But that two weeks has been 10 years coming now. For the last 10 years, every two weeks, they say, “We’re going to have a great healthcare plan.” You know where it is? Because I don’t. The reason they don’t have a plan is because a plan doesn’t exist. They’ve never had one. They’ve instead attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. 
Now they’re trying to get the Supreme Court to take away your healthcare, right now, as quickly as they can, in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. Think about what that would do to families right here in Florida. Florida has the highest enrollment under the Affordable Care Act of any state in America. Last week, Trump flat-out said he hopes the Supreme Court takes your health insurance away. Said it out loud. Don’t boo. Vote. And last night, he installed the Supreme Court justice who he hopes will help him do it. Don’t boo. Vote. Florida, this is serious. And Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare. They will expand Medicare. They’ll make insurance more affordable for everybody. 
Because Joe knows that a president’s first job is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic, and microscopic. When the daily intelligence briefings flash warning lights about a virus, the president can’t ignore it, can’t be too lazy to read the briefing. When Russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in Afghanistan, the commander in chief can’t be MIA, missing in action. Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers because they were willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of the American people. Joe Biden understands those troops are somebody’s kids, somebody’s dad, somebody’s mom, somebody’s husband, somebody’s wife’s, somebody’s father or mother. 
And Joe Biden understands that there is glory and goodness in being willing to sacrifice on behalf of others, something that apparently this administration just doesn’t comprehend. Our current president, he whines that 60 Minutes is too tough. You think he’s going to stand up to dictators? He thinks Leslie Stahl’s a bully. Just yesterday, just yesterday, he said that Putin of Russia, Xi of China, and Kim Jong-Un of North Korea want him to win. We know! We know because you’ve been giving them whatever they want for the last four years. Of course they want you to win. That’s not a good thing. You shouldn’t brag. 
That’s not a good thing. You shouldn’t brag about the fact that some of our greatest adversaries think they’d be better off with you in office. Of course they do. What does that say about you? I mean, think about that. Why are you bragging about that? Come on. And that doesn’t make any sense. Joe Biden wouldn’t coddle dictators. He’ll promote human rights around the world, including in Cuba. Joe will restore our battered standing around the world because he knows our true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. 
And here’s one other thing. Joe and Kamala, when they are in office, they’re not going to have… You’re not going to have to think about them every single day. You’re not going to have to worry about what crazy things they’re going to say, what they’re going to tweet. They’re just going to be too busy doing the work. It just won’t be so exhausting. You’ll be able to go about your lives, knowing that the President’s not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or suggest, I mean, listen, our President of the United States retweeted a post that claimed that the Navy SEALs didn’t actually kill bin Laden. Think about that. And we act like, well, okay. It’s not okay. We’re not going to have a President when Joe Biden’s in office, that goes out of his way to insult people just because they don’t support him. He’ll be a President for all people, including people who didn’t vote for him because he knows that’s the job of being President. 
I mean, we’ve gotten so numb to what is bizarre behavior. We have a President right now who lies multiple times a day, and this is not my claim. Even Fox news sometimes says, well, what he says, isn’t really true, he didn’t mean it. It’s not normal behavior. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a coworker. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a football coach. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a high school principal. I mean, we might have to put up with it if it was a family member, but we talk about them afterwards. Even Florida man wouldn’t be doing some of this stuff. Why would we accept it from President of the United States? And you know what I mean? Sometimes it’s almost too easy to make fun of it, but it’s serious. There are consequences to his actions. 
If he was just on Jerry Springer or something, you’d say well… But this is the most powerful office on earth. And when people see the President doing things like that, it emboldens other people to be mean and cruel and divisive and racist and it frays the fabric of our lives. It affects the way our children see things. When we tell our children to tell the truth, and then we have the person in the highest office in the land who doesn’t seem capable of doing so, that undermines our society. It affects the way our families get along. It affects the way the world looks at America and it distracts from the truly destructive actions that his cronies are doing all across the government as we speak, actions that affect your lives. 
You got the Environmental Protection Agency that’s supposed to protect our air and our water. It’s run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free rein to dump unlimited poison into our air and our water. It’s not right. It ain’t right. The Labor Department, that’s supposed to protect workers. It’s run by a corporate lobbyist who’s declared war on workers, trying to gut protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, making it easier for big corporations to steal their wages. The Interior Department, that’s supposed to protect our public lands, our wilderness, the Everglades, it’s run by an oil lobbyist who’s just fine with selling them to the highest bidder. 
You’ve got an education department run by a billionaire who has gutted rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for-profit colleges. And then is stiff arming students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. You’ve got the person who runs Medicaid, trying not to get more people on the Medicaid so they’ve got better healthcare, but to kick more people off of Medicaid. Come one. It ain’t right. So what are you going to do about it? You got to vote. You got to vote. When Joe and Kamala are in charge, they’re not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists. They’re going to surround themselves with qualified public service, who actually are serious about doing their job, who are looking out for you, for your job, your family, your health, your communities, your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. 
They actually care about you. They actually care about every American and they’re going to be fighting on your behalf every single day. They’re not going to get everything right every time. They’re not going to solve every problem right away, but they’re going to be working on it every single day to see how can I make sure this little brand new baby right here is inheriting a better world. That’s what they care about. I will say that I miss kissing babies during pandemic. I can’t do it, but I look at that a little bundle right there, brand new. It’s got the new baby smell. Congratulations. But Joe and Kamala, they care deeply about people and they care about our democracy. They believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred. We shouldn’t be making people wait in line for hours. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote, not harder. 
They believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest isn’t un-American. This country was founded on protesting against injustice. And we don’t threaten to throw our political opponents in jail just because we disagree with them. That’s what happens in dictatorship. That doesn’t happen in the United States of America. Joe and Kamala understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like the pandemic depends on more than just photo ops. It depends on applying facts and logic and science and not making things up, not flooding the internet with misinformation. These should not be Republican or Democratic values. 
They’re what we grew up learning from our parents and grandparents. They’re not white or black or Hispanic or Asian or Native American values, they’re supposed to be American values. And we have to reclaim them right now. And how are we going to do that? By voting. We’ve got to turn out like never before Orlando. We have to leave no doubt. We can’t be complacent. We were complacent last time. Folks got a little lazy. Folks took things for granted. And look what happened. Not this time, not in this election. I understand there’s some Americans who get frustrated by government. They feel like, oh, it doesn’t make enough of a difference. My vote won’t make a difference. Listen, the government’s not perfect, it’s not going to solve every problem, but a good government can make things better. 
Things were better when I left office, than when I started. They weren’t perfect, but they were better. A President shouldn’t make things worse. A President by himself can’t solve every challenge facing our economy. But if we elect a President who cares and we elect a House and a Senate and a State House and a State Senate that are focused on working people and getting you the help you need, it can make a difference. A President by himself can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we elect District Attorneys and State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs and Police Chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. And that’s what voting is about. Not making things perfect, but making them better. It’s about putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say, hey, things started getting better. It’s about using the power we have and pulling it together, to make- 
It’s about using the power we have and pulling it together to make sure that we have a government that’s more concerned, more responsive, more focused on you. And you know what? When I hear people say, well, I don’t know, I voted last time. Things didn’t change as much as I thought. Listen, we’ve never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted. In 2008, that was the highest voting rate in modern presidential history. You know what? We only got to 61%. That means 39% of the folks didn’t vote who were eligible to vote. What would happen if suddenly we started getting 70% voting rates? What would happen if we got 60, 70% of the people voting instead of 55% of people voting? 
The country would be transformed. Imagine. Imagine January 20th and we swear in a president and a vice-president who have a plan to deal with this pandemic effectively, who believe in science, who have a plan to protect this planet for our children, who care about working Americans, who have a plan to help you start getting ahead, who believe in racial equality, who are willing to do the work to bring us closer to the ideal that no matter what you look like, where you come from, who you love, how much money you got, you can make it here in America. You’ll be treated with respect, and dignity and justice here in America. 
Imagine a president when Puerto Rico gets hit by a hurricane, doesn’t respond just by throwing paper towels, but says, those are Americans and we’ve got to make sure that we get in the help they need as quickly as possible. That’s what you should expect from a president. And if you’re not getting that, then you have to go out there and vote to make it happen. All of that is possible. All of that is within our reach. For all the times these past four years when we’ve seen our worst impulses revealed, the good news is we’ve also seen our best impulses revealed. We’ve seen folks of every age and background pack city centers and town squares so that families wouldn’t be separated. I’ve got a friend, Jose Andress, great restaurateur, took it upon himself, went down to Puerto Rico after the hurricane, organized thousands of meals just on his own because he was seeing that the response wasn’t quick enough. Just did it on his own. That is America. We saw people out on the streets saying, we’re not going to have our classrooms shut up anymore. We’ve seen people activated to make sure our kids don’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We’ve seen healthcare workers, so many of them all across the country, risk their lives every single day just to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people contribute and volunteer to neighbors that have been hit hard. We’ve seen Americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state that black lives matter no more, but no less, for that no child in this country should feel the continuing sting of racism. That’s true in Orlando, it’s true in Florida, it’s true all across this country. 
America is a good and decent place, but we’ve just seen so much noise, and nonsense and distortion, and sometimes it’s hard for us to remember. But Orlando, I’m asking you to remember what this country can be, what it should be, what it must be. I’m asking you to believe in Joe’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, to help us build it back better. Don’t abandon those who are hurting right now. We can’t abandon the kids who aren’t getting the education they need right now. We can’t abandon all those young people who are out on the streets who inspires. We’ve got to channel their activism into action. We can’t just dream for a better future, we got to fight for a better future. We got to out hustle the other side. We’ve got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan, vote as early as you can, grab your friends and your family, get them to vote all the way up and down the ticket. 
And if we pour all our efforts into this final week, if we vote like never before, then we will elect Joe Biden President of the United States. We’ll elect Kamala Harris Vice President of the United States. We will establish once again what this country stands for, what our values are, who we are as a people. Let’s get to work, Florida. Let’s bring it home. I love you, Orlando. I love you Florida. Honk if you’re fired up. Honk if you’re ready to go. Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? I’m fired up. Let’s go do this thing. Let’s bring it home. Thank you."
23,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-remarks-transcript-pennsylvania-october-26,Joe Biden Campaign Remarks Transcript Pennsylvania October 26,"Thanks for letting me be here. The state rep, the mayor’s here as well. I want to thank him very much. Look, yesterday, the White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows went on television to admit to the country that the administration wasn’t even trying, trying anymore to deal with the pandemic. He said and I quote, “We’re not going to control the pandemic.” A Washington Post headline today says is, White House gives up on trying to slow virus spread. No caveats, just a deadly admission. 
Early in this pandemic some of you have had to cover me for a long time, Trump called himself a wartime president fighting a war against an invisible enemy. I’ve been saying for months as you well know that he waved the white flag all the way back then. He wasn’t doing much at all. Some people said I was being harsh, that I was being unfair. The White House was coming right out now and admitting what I said months ago was absolutely true. And look how many people are dead. 220,000 and it’s expected as many as another 200,000 could die between now and the end of the year. 
And he said, “We’re not going to control it.” Not going to control it. The bottom line is Donald Trump is the worst possible president, the worst possible person to try to lead us through this pandemic. I don’t think he just either doesn’t have any idea what to do or he just doesn’t care. On Friday, Dr. Tony Fauci, the nation’s most respected infectious disease expert publicly acknowledged that the president has not even met with his COVID team for months, for months. Even worse, Saturday, Donald Trump said that, “the COVID 19 count was wasn’t really going up. Everything was leveling out.” He suggested the doctors were inflating the numbers. 
Catch this. Because doctors get more money. What in the hell’s the matter with this man? A thousand doctors and nurses have given their lives trying to save lives. And he’s said the reason they’re talking about testing is that they want to make more money. Mr. President, more than 1,000 healthcare workers have lost their lives fighting COVID. Doctors, nurses, they’re not profiting, they’re dying. And you remember during the debate, whatever you want to call it that. During the debate, Trump said that, “We’re learning to live with this COVID. 
No. He’s asking us to learn to die with it. Folks, this has got to end. We can in fact end this crisis. If he would only get together with the House and Senate, work out a compromise on the spending bills that are out there in order to deal with everything from safely open our schools. It will cost $200 billion to do it, but it’s worth doing it. We should do it. We can lower class sizes, more teachers, ventilation PPP, the masks, gloves, all the sanitation. The businesses will be able to be open if we provide the same kind of help, which we said we would do. 
There’s so much more to do. Testing and tracing, we should be pouring billions of dollars into determining how we get rapid testing, rapid testing. So you know within hours whether or not the test is negative or positive. Many places you have to wait some from five up to six or seven days. He’s not doing what needs to be done. And look, folks, I promise you this. I’m never going to give up. You know, Mr. President, you have to have a little bit of shame, just a little bit of shame because people are dying. 
Here’s the point I want to make. Let me say it clearly. More people are going to die as many as 200,000 suggested by some. And it’s pointed out if you just wore a mask, kept social distancing, got tested where we can save within now and the end of the year over a 100,000 American lives. I’m not going to give up. I don’t know what we’ll inherit from January the 21, but the rate he’s going it’s not going to be good, but we’re going to be able to make. 
And by the way, I’m happy to take some questions from the press, but let me make it clear. I’m not shutting down oil fields. I’m not eliminating fracking. I’m investing in clean energy and we’re going to make sure that we don’t continue to subsidize the oil companies. There’s two estimates. They get somewhere between 25 billion and 40 billion in subsidies. That money should go in to making sure we do a lot of other good things. So with that, why don’t I take? Yes, sir. 
I just told you where I’m going to be traveling. And I, by the way I traveled the last few days too. 
I’m going to be going to Iowa. I’m going to Wisconsin. I’m going to Georgia. I’m going to Florida and maybe other places as well. There’s a lot we’ve been doing as well in terms of being online and social … excuse me. Everything from fundraising efforts to making sure we meet. I met today with a group of leaders in the democratic party laying out where we’re going to go, getting their input and like so. We’re constantly, there has not been a day that hadn’t been a 12-hour day yet. 
No, no. Look, you know me. I am not overconfident about anything. I just want to make sure we can earn every vote possible. That’s why we’re here. And you know that blue wall has to be re-established. With the grace of God and the goodwill of the neighbors, I’m going to win Pennsylvania. It’s a matter of a great deal to me personally as well as politically. I think we’re going to win Michigan. I think we’re win Wisconsin. I think we’re going to win Minnesota. I think we have a fighting chance in Ohio. I think we have a fighting chance in North Carolina. We have a fighting chance in Georgia. A fighting chance in Iowa. 
So fortunately because of over six million individual voters, average contributors, average contribution $49, we’re able to compete like we haven’t been able to compete before in all these different states. So that’s why I said we’re going to be traveling, continue to travel. But the big difference between us and reason why it looks like we’re not traveling, we’re not putting on super spreaders. We are doing what we’re doing here. Everybody’s wearing a mask and trying as best we can to be socially distanced. And that’s what we’re doing. You’ve attended a number of our press conferences as well. It’s important to be responsible. 
No, no, no, no, no. There is a question about whether or not it’s a lifetime appointment. I’m not going to attempt to change that at all. There’s some literature among constitutional scholars about the possibility of going from one court to another court, not just always staying the whole time in the Supreme Court. But I have made no judgment, my word. My word is about I made no judgment. There are just a group of serious constitutional scholars who have a number of ideas how we should proceed from this point on. And that’s what we’re going to be doing. I’m going to give them 180 days god willing if I’m elected from the time I’m sworn in to be able to make such a recommendation. 
Look, If you have children and you were raised, all parents are taught that the example you set impacts on how your kids react. When you’re a boss of an operation, the example you set, what you do matters to the rest of the company. Well, the words of a president and the actions of a president, they matter and matter a great deal. And when the President of United States puts on these super spreader events, you saw what happened when she was announced. All the people, including his family, thank God they seem to be okay. All the people came down with COVID. 
I just hope he is willing to have learned a lesson and there’ll be significant social distancing. I don’t blame him for celebrating. There’s a lot of things we could be doing with having massive crowds, but the fact is that it’s just not appropriate now. I just hope he and the vice president and others act with some dispatch and do it what everybody knows. People should be tested first before they even show up, number one. Number two, they should be wearing masks. Number three, they should be socially distanced. And number four, it shouldn’t be a huge crowd, whether it’s outside or not. Thank you all very much. I appreciate it."

What’s up Atlanta. I’m so happy to be back in ATL. Hey everybody. Can we hear it for Rick Hart? Where is he? Where did he go? What’s up Rick? He was so good. He’s so good. He’s the head of the Georgia… There you are. You just tore it up. Rick is the head of the Georgia Students for Biden, the co-chair. And I’ll tell you one of the things that I love about Joe Biden, and he says it often. He understands his long life of service and dedication to public service, but he is always uplifting those who are the emerging leaders, and Rick Hart is one of them. So can we give it up for Rick, because that’s what it’s all about. That’s what it’s all about. It’s about everybody taking on their role of leadership, knowing that we have so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake. And so I came back to Atlanta. 
I love Atlanta. Last time I was here, it was before the pandemic. I spoke on the stage here at Morehouse in March of last year. And come into [inaudible 00:01:47] especially if you are black and hold elected office in America, coming to Atlanta is like coming back to the womb. It really is. It is. Because Atlanta represents so much about who we are as America. Atlanta represents the hopes and the dreams and the fight to make real the promise of America. Atlanta is a place that has produced leaders who have been national leaders and international leaders. Who have always understood that hope will fuel the fight. Faith will be what grounds us in knowing what is possible. But then you got to just organize the folks, and bring people together, and recognize that nothing we have ever achieved as a nation by way of progress, came without a fight. 
And so that’s what we have in front of us. We have for the next 11 days Georgia, a fight for the soul of our nation. This is a fight that we are engaged in, because we believe in the ideals of our country. We believe in our democracy. We know that America’s democracy will always be as strong as we the people are in our willingness to fight for those ideals. And so that’s where we are today. In a fight for the ideals, in a fight for the dignity, in a fight for justice and equal justice under law. And let’s look at what is at stake. So we’re dealing with a pandemic, and we’re dealing with partly because of that, four crises that are occurring at one time in our nation. We’re looking at because of the pandemic, a public health crisis. Where we have seen over 220,000 Americans lose their lives in just the last several months. 
Many of whom tragically in their last days on earth, couldn’t even be with their family, with people they love, because of the nature of this pandemic. We’re looking at over eight and a half million folks who have contracted the virus, thankfully have lived, but are looking at untold long-term consequences. Doctors are talking about things like lung scarring. And in the midst of this public health pandemic, we have a Donald Trump who thanks to Bob Woodward, we know knew back on January 28th, he knew the deal about COVID. He had been informed that it can kill people, that it is five times as likely to kill as the flu. He knew it was airborne. He knew it could harm children. And he sat on that information and he did not tell the American people. Can you imagine what you might’ve done had you known what he knew on January 28th? How folks might’ve prepared? How folks might’ve said, “I got to buy some extra toilet paper,” at the very least. 
But also how the fact is that even in Donald Trump’s America before the pandemic, folks were working two and three jobs to try and pay the bills and pay the rent. Joe Biden I believe in our America, nobody should have to work more than one job to pay their bills and pay their rent and put food on the table. 
And he sat on this information. And then had the gall, had the nerve to say it was a hoax, to muzzle the public health experts. To suggest that he keeps a ledger, and you’re on one side of his ledger if you don’t wear a mask, you’re on another side of his ledger if you wear a mask. And now look where we are. Now look where we are. And he’s in the United States Supreme court where his boy Bill Barr, trying to sue to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And let’s step back for a moment and think about this. This man from the time he was… Even before he was running for office when he questioned the legitimacy of the birthplace of the first black president of the United States, has been so weirdly obsessed with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama created. Think about that. 
We don’t need presidents who have weird obsessions. What is that about? So he is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which brought health coverage to over 20 million Americans. Covered people with pre-existing conditions. You know anybody who has diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, lupus. And he wants to get rid of the thing that brought care and dignity to tens of millions of Americans. This is one of the reasons Donald Trump got to go. Got to go. 
We are in the middle of all these crises, the economic crisis. Over 30 million people in just the last several months had to file for unemployment. We are looking at families that are getting up at the crack of dawn, to drive to sit in their car in a food line for hours. Praying that they can get to the end of the line before the food runs out. One in five mothers in America is describing her children under the age of 12 as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. And you see again, on the one hand you have Joe Biden who says… Let me tell you how I measure the economy and how well it is doing. I measure the greatnesses of the economy based on how working people are doing. How are working people doing? When working people and working families are doing well, then the economy is doing well. 
Which is why Joe Biden and I are saying, “One, taxes will not be raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.” We are saying that we know one of the greatest ways that we achieve access to economic health and intergenerational prosperity is home ownership. So we will have a $15,000 tax credit for first time home buyers, to help you with down payments and closing costs to buy a home. We understand working families need childcare, but nobody should have to pay more than 7% of their income in childcare. That is our commitment. Because we know the economy is doing well when working people are doing well. 
On the other hand you have Donald Trump. Who measures how well the economy is doing based on the stock market. Who measures how well the economy is doing based on how rich people are doing. Who as one of his first orders of business, passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America. I will tell you, Joe Biden and I will make it one of our highest priorities to get rid of that tax bill, and do what we know needs to be done to invest that money in working families. 
Public health crisis and economic crisis is being compared to the great depression. A long overdue reckoning on racial injustice in America. So on one hand you have Joe Biden, who has the knowledge and the courage enough to use the term and speak those words, black lives matter. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who refuses and will never say, “Black lives matter.” And then have the gall to stand on that debate stage at the last debate in front of 70 million Americans, and would not condemn white supremacists. And people have asked me, they say, “Well, Senator Harris… ” By the way senator is not on my birth certificate. It’s Kamala. And they say, “Well, do you think… Are you saying? Do you think he’s a racist?” Yes, yes. 
Because you see, it’s not like it’s some random one off. We’ve seen that pattern going back to him questioning the legitimacy of Barack Obama, going back to Charlottesville. When people were peacefully protesting racial injustice in America, a woman was killed. And on the other side, you had a bunch of neo-Nazis wearing swastikas, carrying Tiki torches, slurring, throwing out anti-Semitic and racist slurs, and Donald Trump said, “Well, there are fine people on both sides.” 
A president of the United States who referred to Mexicans as rapists and criminals. A president of the United States who made as one of his first policy initiatives, a ban on Muslims entering our country. And then stood on that stage and would not condemn known white supremacist, and then double down and said, “Well, they should stand back and stand by.” This is not reflective of who we believe we are as a nation. We need a president who acknowledges systemic racism, who acknowledges the history of America, and uses that bully pulpit and that microphone, in a way that speaks truth with an intention to address the inequities and bring our country together. And that is Joe Biden. 
Four crises. Public health, economic, a grappling and a need to deal with racial injustice, and a climate crisis. So I come from California. I was born in Oakland, California. And we have some…. You know. Okay. The West Coast has been burning because of those wildfires. California, Oregon, Washington, the Gulf States have been battered by these storms. People in the Midwest, farmers have lost whole season of crops because of the floods. 
So Joe Biden says, “We need to embrace science. We need to deal with it. This is something that is hurting people. It is something that we can address in a way we also create jobs by investing in infrastructure, investing in building renewable energy. That’s going to be about jobs. Joe Biden knows the seriousness of environmental justice issues. He knows that of all of the areas where people live in America with poor air quality, 70% of the people in those areas are people of color. Joe Biden knows what’s going on at Flint. Joe Biden says, “We need to address this and we need to pay attention to science.” On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who recently when he was asked about the wildfires in California… And the reporter said something like, “Well, so the scientists are basically saying these fires, what’s happening, the scientists are saying, ‘there’s a connection between this drastic changes in the climate and these wildfires.’ You know what the president of the United States said in response? “Science doesn’t know.” What! 
Science doesn’t know the president of the United States. And what we see is a through line, right, on that issue and the first issue. An inability to embrace fact. An inability to embrace experts. An inability to embrace intelligence. An inability to be competent. An inability to do the job of Commander in Chief of the United States, whose first responsibility is to concern themselves with the health and safety of the American people. And that’s why we going to like Joe Biden. There is so much at stake. 
Now, you all know… And Atlanta helped me when I ran for Senate, and I am now the only black woman in the United States Senate. Only the second in America’s history to be elected to the United States Senate. And I’m going to tell you because I’ve been there now for almost four years. The Senate is so important on all these issues. We need to take back the white house, there’s no question about that. We also need to take back the Senate. We need to take back the Senate. It’s the senators that will make decisions about advise and consent on who sits in the United States Supreme Court, right? One of the reasons I became a lawyer is because I was inspired by Thurgood Marshall and Charles Hamilton Houston and Constance Baker Motley, right? 
They are the ones who fought for Brown v. Board of Education. They are the ones who have fought for civil rights. Who sits in the United States Supreme Court has everything to do with our fight for equality. Well, it’s going to be the president who nominates somebody, but it’s the Senate who advise and consent will make the decision about whether it goes through. And right now we’re seeing that battle in full relief, with this illegitimate process they’ve engaged in to try and fill the seat of the great Ruth Bader Ginsburg, while people are voting in an election. The majority of American people say, “Let us decide who will be our president, and then let that person decide who fills that seat?” The United States Senate. The United States Senate is where there will be a decision on whether we put on the floor a bill that my brother Cory Booker from New Jersey and I wrote, called the George Floyd Justice and Policing Act. A bill that says like Joe Biden and I say, “We should ban chokeholds and carotid holds,” because George Floyd would be alive today if that were the case. 
A bill that says, “Let’s have a national registry of police officers who break the law,” because that is the right thing to do. And we can’t have folks just get fired one place and then they’ll get hired somewhere else. It says, “We need to have a national standard for excessive use of force.” Because it’s not right that in some places when there is excessive use of force the question asked is, “Was it reasonable?” When we all know you couldn’t reason a way just about anything. And the more fair and just question to ask is, “Was it necessary?” We need to change the standard. 
Those kinds of decisions, yes they get made from the White House, and we will make them. It also gets made in the Senate. And so that brings me to Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. And Georgia you got to send them to the United States Senate. Send them to the United States Senate. Let them represent Georgia on all these issues. It is critically important. And you know those Senate seats, those are six year terms. Think about your plans for your life and for your children’s life, over the course of the next six years. There’s a lot that can get done, either for good or for not. These Senate seats are so important. 
So I’m here, Atlanta, Georgia, to ask you to do what I know you already know how to do so well. Which is to organize. Which is to talk to folks about what’s at stake. Which is to remind people on the issue of voting. That we’ve got so many reasons. One has to do with again, Atlanta, it has to do with John Lewis. It has to do with those men and women who shed blood on that Edmund Pettus Bridge and so many other places, for our right to vote. And so voting is about honoring those ancestors. Honoring what they fought for and what they sacrificed for our right to vote. Voting is because there is so much at stake. Everything that we discussed. Everything that affects our lives. And voting also is because we’re not going to let anyone mess with our right to vote. 
Because here’s how I think about that. Step back and think about… And I’ve been spending a lot of time all over. I’ve been to Florida this week. I was in North Carolina this week. I’ll be in Ohio tomorrow. But think about it from this perspective. Ever since and even before they gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013, a whole lot of really powerful people including in this state, because otherwise we would be talking about Governor Stacey. A whole lot of powerful people for quite some time, have been trying to suppress our vote. Have been trying to purge the voter rolls. Have been trying to confuse us about the process, to make it difficult. “Oh, you can fill out your ballot and then put it in one envelope. But then you need to put it in another envelope and make sure that’s signed.” Trying to confuse us, trying to make it difficult. Messing with the post office. Can you imagine? The post office. Like the postman, the postwoman. They’re messing with the post office. 
And we have to at some point sit back and think, “Why are they trying to make it so difficult and confusing for us to vote?” And I think the answer is because they know our power. They know our power. They know when we vote, things change. They know when we vote, we win. And so I’m here to say Atlanta, let’s not let anybody take our power from us. We know the power of our voice. We know at election time the power of our voice is expressed through our vote. We’re not going to let anybody take us out this game. We are present. We are powerful. We are active. And we know what’s at stake and we honor our ancestors every day. And so my last point is this, this moment will pass. And years from now, our children, our grandchildren and others, they will look in our eyes each one of us, and they will ask us, “Where were you at that time?” 
And the thing we’re going to be able to tell them, is so much more than just how we felt. What we will tell them is what we did. We will tell them, “There was this one particular afternoon we were hanging out at Morehouse in the parking lot… ” We will tell them we organized, that we talked to our neighbors and our friends and our relatives. We will tell them we helped people get to the polls. We will tell them a mandatory Saturday which is tomorrow, that we made sure everyone we know, got to their County office to vote. We will tell them we stood up and we fought for our country, and we fought for the ideas because we love our country and we know our power. Thank you Atlanta."

Man, it is good to be back in Pennsylvania. What beautiful weather we got here. Little Indian summer. I know the president spent some time in Erie last night, and apparently he complained about having to travel here. And then he cut the event short, poor guy. I don’t feel that way. I love coming to Pennsylvania. You guys delivered for me twice and I am back here tonight to ask you to deliver the White House for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. I want to thank Mr. Philadelphia, Charlie Mack, his daughter, India Marie. What an outstanding young lady she was. Those of you who are fathers and have daughters you know how that feels when you see your daughters just shining. I know a little bit about that. And it was great to see representatives, Brendan Boyle, Mary Gay Scanlon, Governor Tom Wolf, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, Mayor Jim Kenney. Philadelphia we got 13 days. That’s our lucky number right here. 13 days until the most important election of our lifetimes. 
And you don’t have to wait for November 3rd to cast your ballot. You’ve got two ways to vote right now. Number one, you can vote early in person through next Tuesday. Anybody here voted early already? If you haven’t, just go to iwillvote.com/pa and find out where you can vote early. Number two, you can vote from home with a mail-in ballot. Just go to iwillvote.com/pa to request your ballot right away. And before you send it back, Pennsylvania’s got this thing where you’ve got to use both envelopes. So you’ve got to read the directions carefully to make sure your vote counts. And if you’ve already voted, then you’ve got to help your friends and family make a plan to vote. Take them with you if you vote early, or if you vote in-person on election day, because this election requires every single one of us to do our part. And what we do these next 13 days will matter for decades to come. 
Now, last time I was in Philadelphia, I was at the constitution center and I was delivering a speech for the Democratic National Convention this year. And I said, during that speech, I’ve sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. And they are very different people. I explained that I never thought Donald Trump would embrace my vision or continue my policies but I did hope for the sake of the country that he might show some interest in taking the job seriously, but it hasn’t happened. He hasn’t shown any interest in doing the work or helping anybody but himself and his friends or treating the presidency like a reality show that he can use to get attention. And by the way, even then his TV ratings are down. So you know that upsets him. 
But the thing is, this is not a reality show, this is reality. And the rest of us have had to live with the consequences of him proving himself incapable of taking the job seriously. At least 220,000 Americans have died. More than 100,000 small businesses have closed. Millions of jobs are gone. Our proud reputation around the world is in tatters. Presidents up for reelection usually ask if the country is better off than it was four years ago. I’ll tell you one thing, four years ago you’d be tailgating here at the Lincoln instead of watching a speech from your cars. The only people truly better off than they were four years ago are the billionaires who got his tax cuts. Right now as we speak, Trump won’t even extend relief to the millions of families who are having trouble paying the rent or putting food on the table because of this pandemic. But he’s been doing all right by himself. As it turns out, this was just reported in the last 48 hours. 
We know that he continues to do business with China because he’s got a secret Chinese bank account. How is that possible? How is that possible? A secret Chinese bank account. Listen, can you imagine if I had had a secret Chinese bank account when I was running for reelection. You think Fox News might have been a little concerned about that? They would’ve called me Beijing Berry. It is not a great idea to have a president who owes a bunch of money to people overseas. That’s not a good idea. I mean, of the taxes Donald Trump pays, he may be sending more to foreign governments than he pays in the United States. His first year in the White House he only paid $750 in federal income tax. Listen, my first job was at a Baskin Robbins when I was 15 years old. I think I’m might have paid more taxes that year working at a dispensing ice cream. How is that possible? How many people here pay less than that? It’s just possible now that if you are living high on the hog and you only pay $750 in taxes that maybe, just maybe he might not know what working people are going through here in Pennsylvania. We cannot afford four more years of this, Philadelphia. But the good news is right now you can choose change. Right now you can vote for my friend Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris as the next president and vice president of the United States of America. Now, Joe’s no stranger to here. He’s a native son. Scrappy kid from scratch. You know him and he knows you. But let me, let me tell you how I came to Norman and how I came to love him. 12 years ago, when I chose Joe Biden as my vice presidential running mate, I didn’t know Joe all that well. We had served in the Senate together, but we weren’t super close. He and I came from different places. We came from different generations. 
But I came to admire Joe as a man who has learned early on to treat everybody he meets with dignity and respect, living by the words his parents taught him, no one’s better than you Joe, but you’re better than nobody. And that empathy, that decency, that belief that everybody counts, that’s who Joe is. That’s who he’ll be. And I can tell you the presidency doesn’t change who you are, it reveals who you are. And Joe has shown himself to be a friend of working people. For eight years, Joe was the last one in the room when I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he’s got the character and experience to make us a better country. And he and Kamala- 
A better country. And he and Kamala are going to be in the fight, not for themselves but for every single one of us. Well, I get that this president wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic that he ignored. But you know what? The job doesn’t work that way. Tweeting at the television doesn’t fix things. Making stuff up doesn’t make people’s lives better. You’ve got to have a plan. You’ve got to put in the work. And along with the experience to get things done, Joe Biden has concrete plans and policies that will turn our vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into a reality. 
We literally left this White House a pandemic playbook that would have shown them how to respond before the virus reached our shores. They probably used it to I don’t know, prop up a wobbly table somewhere. We don’t know where that playbook went. Eight months into this pandemic, cases are rising again across this country. Donald Trump isn’t suddenly going to protect all of us. He can’t even take the basic steps to protect himself. Just last night, he complained up in eerie that the pandemic made him go back to work. I’m quoting him. He was upset that the pandemic’s made him go back to work. If he’d actually been working the whole time, it never would’ve gotten this bad. 
So, look, here’s the truth. I want to be honest here. This pandemic would have been challenging for any president but this idea that somehow this White House has done anything but completely screw this up. It’s just not true. I’ll give you a very specific example. Korea identified it’s first case at the same time that the United States did. At the same time, their per capita death toll is just 1.3% of what ours is. In Canada, it’s just 39% of what ours is. Other countries are still struggling with the pandemic but they’re not doing as bad as we are because they’ve got a government that’s actually been paying attention. 
And that means lives lost. And that means an economy that doesn’t work. And just yesterday, when asked if he’d do anything differently, Trump said, “Not much.” Really? Not much? Nothing you can think of that could have helped some people keep their loved ones alive? So, Joe’s not going to screw up testing. He’s not going to call scientists idiots. He’s not going to host a super spreader event at the White House. Joe will get this pandemic under control with a plan to make testing free and widely available, to get a vaccine to every American cost free and to make sure our frontline heroes never ask other countries for their equipment they need. 
His plan will guarantee paid sick leave for workers and parents affected by the pandemic and make sure that the small businesses that hold our communities together and employ millions of Americans can reopen safely. Donald Trump likes to claim he built this economy but America created 1.5 million more jobs in the last three years of the Obama-Biden administration than in the first three years of the Trump-Pence administration. How you figure that? And that was before he could blame the pandemic. Now, he did inherit the longest streak of job growth in American history but just like everything else he inherited, he messed it up. The economic damage he inflicted by botching the pandemic response means he will be the first president since Herbert Hoover to actually lose jobs. Joe’s got a plan to create 10 million good clean energy jobs as part of a historic $2 trillion investment to fight climate change, to secure environmental justice. And he’ll pay for it by rolling back that tax cut for billionaires. And Joe sees this moment not just as a chance to get back to where we were but to finally make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody, the waitress trying to raise her kid on her own, the student trying to figure out how to pay for next semester’s classes, the shift worker who’s always on the edge of getting laid off, the cancer survivor who’s worried about her preexisting conditions, protections being taken away. 
Let me tell you something Pennsylvania. This I know to be true, Joe and Kamala will protect your healthcare and expand Medicare and make insurance more affordable for everybody. Republicans love to say right before an election that they’ll protect your preexisting conditions. Now, Joe and I actually protected your policies to make sure people with preexisting conditions could get health insurance and have coverage. We did it through something called the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a Obamacare. And Republicans tried to repeal or undermine it more than 60 times. 
And when they’ve been asked about, they keep on promising, “We’re going to have a great replacement.” They said, “It’s coming.” It’s been coming in two weeks for the last 10 years. Where is it? Where is this great plan to replace Obamacare? They’ve had 10 years to do it. There is no plan. They’ve never had one. Instead they’ve attacked the Affordable Care Act at every turn, driving up costs, driving up the uninsured. Now, they’re trying to dismantle your care in the Supreme court as we speak as quickly as they can in the middle of a pandemic with nothing but empty promises to take its place. It’s shameful. The idea that you would take healthcare away from people at the very moment where people need it most, what is the logic of that? There is no logic. Joe knows that the first job of a president is to keep us safe from all threats, foreign, domestic or microscopic. When the daily intelligence briefings flash warning signs about a virus, a president can’t ignore them. He can’t be AWOL. Just like when Russia puts bounties on the heads of our soldiers in Afghanistan, the commander-in-chief can’t be missing in action. I can tell you this, Joe Biden would never call the men and women of our military suckers or losers. Who does that? He knows these heroes are somebody’s children, somebody’s spouse, somebody’s dad or mom. He understands that. And he’s going to restore our standing in the world because he knows that America’s true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators, a nation that can mobilize and inspire others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism and poverty and disease. And with Joe and Kamala at the helm, you’re not going to have to think about the crazy things they said every day. And that’s worth a lot. You’re not going to have to argue about them every day. 
It just won’t be so exhausting. You might be able to have a Thanksgiving dinner without having an argument. You’ll be able to go about your lives knowing that the president is not going to retweet conspiracy theories about secret cabals running the world or that maybe seals didn’t actually kill bin Laden. Think about that. The president of the United States retweeted that. Imagine. What? What? We’re not going to have a president that goes out of his way to insult anybody who doesn’t support him or threaten them with jail. That’s not normal presidential behavior. 
That’s not normal presidential behavior. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a high school principal. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a coach. We wouldn’t tolerate it from a co-worker. We wouldn’t tolerate it in our family, except for maybe crazy uncle somewhere. I mean, why would we expect and accept this from the President of the United States? And why are folks making excuses for that? “Oh, well, that’s just him.” No. There are consequences to these actions. They embolden other people to be cruel and divisive and racist, and it frays the fabric of our society, and it affects how our children see things. And it affects the ways that our families get along. It affects how the world looks at America. That behavior matters. Character matters. And by the way, while he’s doing all that, it distracts all of us from the truly destructive actions that his appointees are doing all across the government, actions that affect your lives. The Environmental Protection Agency that’s supposed to protect our air and our water is right now run by an energy lobbyist that gives polluters free reign to dump unlimited poison into our air and water. The Labor Department that’s supposed to protect workers and their rights, right now it’s run by a corporate lobbyist who’s declared war on workers, guts protections to keep essential folks safe during a pandemic, makes it easier for big corporations to shortchange them on their wages. The Interior Department, that’s supposed to protect our public lands and wild spaces, our wildlife and our wilderness. And right now that’s run by an oil lobbyist who’s determined to sell them to the highest bidder. 
You’ve got the Education Department that’s supposed to give every kid a chance, and that’s run by a billionaire who guts rules designed to protect students from getting ripped off by for profit colleges and stiffs arm students looking for loan relief in the middle of an economic collapse. I mean, the person who runs Medicaid right now is doing their best to kick people off of Medicaid instead of sign them up for Medicaid. Come on. When Joe and Kamala are in charge, they’re not going to surround themselves with hacks and lobbyists, but they’re going to appoint qualified public servants who actually care about looking out for you, for your job, for your family, for your health, for your security, for your planet, and that more than anything is what separates them from their opponents. They actually care about every American, including the ones that don’t agree with them. 
And they’re going to fight for you every day. They care about you and they care about this democracy. They believe in a democracy. The right to vote is sacred and that we shouldn’t be making people wait in line for 10 hours to cast their ballot. We should be making it easier for everybody to vote. They believe that no one, especially the President, is above the law. They understand that protest on behalf of social justice isn’t un-American. That’s the most American thing there is. That’s how this country was founded, protesting injustice. They understand we don’t threaten our political opponents threatening to throw them in jail, just because we disagree with them. They understand that our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depends more than on just photo-ops. It depends on actually learning the facts and following the science and not just making stuff up whenever it’s convenient. 
Our democracy is not going to work if the people who are supposed to be our leaders lie every day and just make things up. And we’ve just become numb to it. We’ve just become immune to it. Every single day, fact checkers can’t keep up. And, look, this notion of truthfulness and democracy and citizenship, and being responsible, these aren’t Republican or democratic principles, they’re American principles. They’re what most of us grew up learning from our parents and our grandparents. They’re not White or Black or Latino or Asian values, they’re American values, human values, and we need to reclaim them. We have to get those values back at the center of our public life. And we can. But to do it, we’ve got to turn out like never before. We cannot leave any doubt in this election, because you know the President’s already said, “If this is even close, I’m going to just make stuff up.” He’s already started to do it. 
So we can’t have any doubt. We can’t be complacent. I don’t care about the polls. There were a whole bunch of polls last time, didn’t work out, because a whole bunch of folks stayed at home and got lazy and complacent. Not this time, not in this election, not this time. Listen, listen. I understand why a lot of Americans can get frustrated by government and can feel like it doesn’t make a difference. Even supporters of mine, during my eight years, there were times where stuff we wanted to get done didn’t get done and people said, “Well, gosh, if Obama didn’t get it done, then maybe it’s just not going to happen.” Look, government is not going to solve every problem, it’s true. Every elected officials going to make some mistakes. This is a big complicated country and the system’s designed so that change happens slowly. It doesn’t happen overnight. 
And believe me, I’ve got firsthand experience with the way Republicans in Congress abused the rules to make it easy for special interest to stop progress. But we can make things better, and we shouldn’t be making things worse. A president by himself can’t solve every challenge in a global economy. But if we’ve got Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the White House at a House and Senate that are focused on working people, it can make a difference and get millions of people the help they need. A president by himself can’t eliminate all racial bias in our criminal justice system. But if we’ve got district attorneys and state’s attorneys and sheriffs and police chiefs focused on equality and justice, it can make things better. In Pennsylvania, you’ve just got to flip nine seats in your State House, just five seats in your State Senate, to give Democrats control and new life for policies that’ll make a real difference to working families right now. It can make things better. 
In the end, Pennsylvania, that’s what voting’s about, making things better, not making things perfect, but putting us on track so that a generation from now we can look back and say, “Things got better starting now.” And that’s what voting’s about. Voting’s about using the power we have and pooling it together to get a government that’s more concerned and more responsive and more focused on you and your lives and your children and your grandchildren and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of … 
… and future generations. And the fact that we don’t get 100% of what we want right away is not a good reason not to vote. It means we’ve got to vote and then get some change and then vote some more and then get some more change, and then keep on voting until we get it right. 
And we will never come close to seeing what it would be like if everybody voted, when I hear people say, “Well, I don’t know, you’re voting don’t make a difference.” We don’t know because usually no more than half the people who could be voting vote. 
We get 50, 55% of people voting. And then people say, “Well, look, not enough change happened.” Well, imagine what would happen if 60% voted? What about 70%? Imagine January 20th, when we swear in a president and a vice president who have a plan to get us out of this mess, who believe in science, and they have a plan to protect this planet for our kids, and who care about working Americans, and they have a plan to help you start getting ahead. 
And who believe in racial equality and gender equality, and believe in not discriminating against people because of their sexual orientation, and are willing to bring us closer to an America where no matter what we look like and where we come from, who we love and what our last name is, if we go out there and we work, we can make it. 
And we’re part of an American family. All of that is possible. All of that is within our reach, if we vote. Because let me tell you something Pennsylvanians, people ask me sometimes, they say, “Man, how have you been able to take these last four years, just watching all this? How do you keep your spirits up?” 
And I tell him, I say, look for all the times, these last four years that we’ve seen our worst impulses revealed, we’ve also seen what our country can be at its best. We’ve seen folks of every age and background who’ve packed city centers and airports in town squares, just so families wouldn’t be separated. 
So another classroom wouldn’t get shot up, so our kids wouldn’t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. We’ve seen Americans more racist, joining together to declare in the face of injustice that black lives matter, no more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. 
We’ve seen folks, our essential workers, our healthcare workers risking their lives day in day out to save somebody else’s loved ones. We’ve seen people volunteer and contribute to help those who are having an especially difficult time that right now. 
That’s true in Pennsylvania, that’s true all across the country. America is a good and decent place, but we’ve just seen so much noise and nonsense that sometimes it’s hard for us to remember. 
Philadelphia, I’m asking you to remember what this country can be. What it’s like when we treat each other with respect and dignity, what it’s like when our elected officials actually behave responsibly. I’m asking you to believe in Joe’s ability, in Kamala’s ability to lead this country out of these dark times, and help us build it back better, because we can’t abandon those who are hurting right now. We can’t abandon the children who aren’t getting the education they need right now. 
We can’t abandon those protesters who inspired us. We’ve got to channel their activism into action, we can’t just imagine a better future. We’ve got to fight for it. We’ve got to out hustle the other side, we got to outwork the other side, we’ve got to vote like never before and leave no doubt. So make a plan right now, for how you’re going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can. Tell your family, tell your friends how they can vote. Don’t stop with Joe and Kamala, make sure you vote all the way down the ticket. 
And if we pour all our efforts into these 13 days, if we vote up and down the ticket, like never before, then we will not only elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, we will also leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for. We will not leave any doubt about who we are as a people, and the values and ideals that we embrace. 
What Lincoln called the better angels of our nature, those are still in us. We see them operating every single day. We see them in neighborhoods, we see them in churches and synagogues and mosques and temples. We see them in people helping out a neighbor. We see them them inside our own families. We see that what is best in us is still there, but we’ve got to give it voice, and we’ve got to do it now. 
So let’s get to work people. Let’s bring this home. I love you, Philadelphia. Honk if you’re fired up, honk if you’re ready to go. Are you fired up? 
Are you ready to go? Are you fired up? Are you ready to go? 
Let’s go make it happen. I love you Philadelphia. Thank you. I love you. Come on."
26,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/barack-obama-campaign-roundtable-event-for-joe-biden-kamala-harris-transcript-october-21,Barack Obama Campaign Roundtable Event for Joe Biden & Kamala Harris Transcript October 21,"… or the ’40s or the ’30s, because if you talk to folks who did, they ain’t going to say nothing changed. The reason things changed was because folks voted. That’s how the Voting Rights Act got passed. That’s how the Civil Rights Act got passed up and down the line. And that’s going to continue to be how we bring about changes. So now I have to say, while I’m working out, I’m still thinking someday maybe I’ll look like The Rock. Maybe if I shave my head. All right, what else we got? 
Well, look, first of all, a couple of things I got to say. For those of you who were not aware, my first political office was State Senator, so I’m always a little biased towards state senators, because it’s a great experience, especially in a big state like Pennsylvania or Illinois, because it allows you to meet people from all different kinds of the state and form coalitions. And ultimately that’s how you end up mobilizing the power you need to bring about real change. And it’s part of the reason why I’m confident that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to be able to deliver on some of their promises because they know how to make coalitions. 
And I think it’s important for us, anyone in the African-American community, to recognize that although our problems are more acute than many other communities, there are people of all races, all faiths in regions throughout this state and across the country that are also hurting. And those are potential allies and partners, if we can get past the constant division that is fed, attempting to set ourselves apart. And that’s been a long history in America, by the way, which is you try to distract working people from coming together to work together by highlighting racial differences or religious differences so that the people who got what they got can keep what they got. Now in terms of getting young people to vote, look, I’ve got two spectacular daughters, who are about as well informed and conscious and active as just about anybody, as you might imagine they would be because they’ve got Michelle Obama as a role model. But Michelle and I also joke, sometimes they’ll sit there and they’re really sophisticated and making all these important points, showing what they’ve been studying around history and they’ll quote Frederick Douglass and Fannie Lou Hamer, and you start thinking, “Wow.” And then they’ll do something that reminds you, “Oh, they’re only 20,” because they’re young. A lot of the young men you speak of, it’s not just that they’re African-American males. They’re young. And young people have a lot of distractions and it is rare, and I will confess that when I was 20 years old, I wasn’t all that woke, because I had other stuff that I was interested in. We won’t go into the details. 
So a lot of times I think our young men, they may try to give a ration now for why they’re not active and involved, but the truth is they’re not active and involved because they’re young and they’re distracted. And the way I think to break that mindset, if you look at every study of voting patterns, people vote when they see other people voting, when they see their peer group voting. So I think that the most important thing we can do in these closing 12, 13 days is for us all to model and advertise that it’s the cool thing and the right thing to do to vote, and to do it where they are. 
So I notice that my children, they don’t watch TV that has advertising, because they’re streaming everything. Either it’s on a phone. If they are watching TV, they’ve prerecorded it. That’s not a way to reach them, which means that organizations like yours that already have contacts, let’s take your mosque. For you to create something digitally that says, “Here’s all the people that are going to vote. We’re going to take a tally of who’s already voted. We’re going to have something, maybe a mixer or something, but you’ve got to have your voting sticker on.” Whatever it is that meets them where they are rather than expecting that they’re going to be responding to the same kinds of things that a 50-year-old man might respond to. I think that’s really important. And they have to see that their peers are voting. So trying to figure out how … I think Joe and Kamala have done a good job- 
Joe and Kamala have done a good job in listing some validators and influencers on social media that they listen to. But a lot of times, there are local folks that may not be as famous as- 
As me. Yeah. Right. I wasn’t going to say it, but like Busta Rhymes. Right? Although even Busta’s almost my age, I don’t know. You showing your age now. You’re talking about Busta Rhymes, man. Come on. 
That’s outstanding. 
Well, first of all, how old are you, man? 
You’re 36. You seem like a extraordinary young man. You may not be old enough to know that Bulls fans generally don’t like Isaiah Thomas. So I want you to watch the Last Dance in case you missed it. It’s on ESPN. 
Listen, first of all, I want to congratulate you because seeing young talent, right, I think is what always gives me hope. You’re going to know your communities better than I do. One thing I would do is to, as much as possible, focus on concrete issues that will be affected, not just by the presidency, but also down ballot. Now, let me take a couple of examples. The senator here was mentioning that the emergency federal stimulus package didn’t reach a lot of Black businesses. That is something that we’re almost certainly going to have to revisit. It doesn’t, right now, look like it may get done before the election. And who knows what may happen right after the election? But the economy is still in dire straits, and small businesses are falling left and right. When you look at how that money was distributed, there weren’t a lot of people who look like small business people in this community that were reached by it. 
So that’s something concrete and specific that I feel confident you can promise, which is if Joe Biden is elected and Kamala Harris are elected, the next round of emergency spending by the federal government to help support small businesses is going to be structured so that it’s more representative and every community benefits, not just some. And it’s going to be small businesses and not just big corporations. I think it’s also important to remind young people, though, that it’s not just the president and the vice president that are on the ticket. So here in Pennsylvania, flipping the state legislature could then start dealing with issues like gun safety. 
You could then start looking at reforms around how the criminal justice system operates in this state, school funding, how we think about diversion programs for young people. Right? There are a whole host of issues that are going to be determined in this election, not just the presidential and the vice presidential race. And I think it’s really important sometimes when we’re talking to young people to listen to them, what is it that they’re concerned about? 
One of the things I learned when I first went to Chicago, I’m in the south side, I’m ready to set the world on fire and go out there and organize. And I had been hired by a group of churches who were dealing with many of the community problems that still face an air like this. And I was 10 years younger than you, I was 25. And the guy who had hired me, he said, “I want you to just spend the first month, I’d want you to just go around talking to people and listening to them to find out what it is that they care about. Because a lot of times, we go around, instead of listening, we just want to tell people what they should care about. But we don’t take the time to find out what do you care about?” 
And I think, Councilman, in these last 12 days, you probably have a sense of some of the things they care about. But if I’m engaging a young person, the first thing I ask him is, “Well, what’s an issue that’s really important to you?” And as soon as they say anything, I guarantee you I can find something about that issue that’s going to be impacted by this election. So then I can turn it around on them and I can say, “Oh, well, if you really care about this, let me be very specific about how this is impacted by what’s happening in the state legislature, what’s happening at the federal government, what’s happening in terms of who the district attorney is or the state’s attorney is, what’s happening in terms of how budgets work.” 
Because ultimately, one of the biggest tricks that’s perpetrated on the American people is this idea that the government is separate from you. The government’s us. Of, by, and for the people. It wasn’t always for all of us, but the way it’s designed, it works based on who’s at the table. And if you do not vote, you are not at the table. And then, yes, then stuff is done to you. If you’re at the table, then you’re part of the solution. And I really want to emphasize to young people as much as possible in ’08, when I was elected, we had the highest African-American turnout in history, but it was still only about 60%. Yeah. When people say voting doesn’t make a difference, we’ve never tried what it would look like if it was 80% voting or 90% voting. During midterm elections, we get 30% of people voting, and probably 15% of young people voting. Well, you don’t know if it’s going to work if you don’t try it. So with young people, what I would say to them is look, give this a shot. 
Give this a shot. Because one thing I can say for certain is that, after having been in office for eight years, the country was better than when I came into office. And I can show that by any measure. So yeah, voting worked. It didn’t make everything perfect, but we solved a whole lot of problems. And the same is going to be true here locally in Philadelphia. We can make things better, and better is good. And I always used to tell my staff, “Nothing wrong with better.” All right? 
How am I doing on time here? Because I know, at some point, they’re going to yank me, because that’s- 
I’ll take two. 
And let me just say, if you don’t think things have changed, having a brother in the state legislature with that haircut. That’s a change. It looks sharp, man. But I’m just saying, you didn’t see that 20 years ago. 
That’s good, man. Give him a little props. 
When I burst onto the national scene, it was after I had won the nomination to be the US Senator from Illinois, and I was invited to be the keynote at the Democratic National Convention in Boston. And I talked about hope and the audacity of hope in that. And I made this point about hope, which was, hope is not blind optimism. Hope is not ignoring problems. Hope is believing, in the face of difficulty, that we can overcome and get a better world. Hope is looking squarely at our challenges and our shortcomings and saying, “Despite that, I think through effort and will and community, we can make things better.” 
And so, I’ve never lost hope over these last four years. I’ve been mad, I’ve been frustrated, but I haven’t lost hope. And the reason is, is because I never expected progress to move directly in a straight line. If you look at the history of this country, you make progress and then there’s some backpedaling and backlash. And you consolidate some victories and then there’s some slippage and then you get a renewed surge of energy and then you make some more progress, and then there’s this little bit of back stepping and then you push again. And I think what we’ve seen over the last four years was a… With my election, I think we had probably gotten over optimistic about how much change had happened in the country, but that change was real. There was some pushback and that was real too. But when we started seeing all these young people from across the country demonstrating this summer, it reminded you they internalize that sense of optimism and change and possibility. 
So what gives me optimism is when I see them, I say, “Okay, here we are, back to make another push.” People like you, people like the Councilman, you guys are out there and you’re going to push it to the next phase. And then you’re not going to get 100% of what we need. And there’ll be some disappointments and areas where you fall short and then it’ll go back a little bit and then you push forward again. But the benefits of age is realizing that, in any endeavor, there are going to be setbacks, there are going to be times where you fall short, there are going to be people who are opposed to trying to do the right thing. And the test of our strength as a people is our ability to push through that on through to the next stage. And I have never given up that sense of, we are resilient and strong enough to push through what we’ve seen in these last four years. 
Now, the question is, making sure that we understand we can’t afford another four years of this. Because what happens is you do get to a point where you go so far backwards, that it becomes really hard then to dig yourself out of that hole. And I’m so confident in Joe Biden and Kamala Harris surrounding themselves with people who are serious, who know what they’re doing, who are representative of all people, not just some people, and us being able to then dig ourselves out of this hole. And we’re in a deep one. You talk about, let’s say, the pandemic. The pandemic would have been tough for any president. We haven’t seen something like this for 100 years. But the degree of incompetence and misinformation, the number of people who might not have died had we just done the basics, the degree to which it has impacted low income communities so disproportionately, that’s something that I’m not just confident that it can be fixed, there’s proof. Canada, right across the border. 
You’ve got 39% fewer deaths, almost 40%. We have examples. Knowing Joe as well as I do, knowing Kamala as well as I do, knowing the people that are advising them, I know we will be able to deal with this pandemic more effectively. It doesn’t mean that it’s all going to be solved tomorrow. We’re still going to have some struggles, but I know we can do better. And that’s what gives me confidence. That’s what gives me hope. But we’re going to have to vote in order for that to happen. All right, last question. 
No, go ahead. He can introduce himself. 
He doesn’t need a hype man. DJ Khaled here. What’s your name, man? 
Well, first of all, did the Senator say you worked with Michelle? 
Fantastic. All right. 
Look, we’re going to have a big task ahead of us in providing a better education curriculum on citizenship, and we could have a long conversation about part of the problem in our schools. The degree to which we teach kids from these worksheets and stuff that has no reference to the lives around them, instead of teaching them based on their experience and what is right in front of them. They’re reading about stuff that has nothing to do with what they’re seeing, words that have no correspondence to their lived experience. So, that’s a longer conversation. 
It’s never too early to start with young people and explaining to them what I just said earlier, which is the government is you, that in the same way that when you go out with your friends and you got to make a decision about what pizza you’re going to get, and is it going to be cheese or pepperoni? Or that you all decide, if there’re 10 of you or five of you, you go, “We’ll take a vote because we can only afford one pizza.” Well, you guys are exercising self-government. 
Here’s the history of what’s happened, which is that it used to be only a few people got to make the decisions for everybody. Because of people worked hard and they struggled and they voted and they fought for the right to vote, more and more people got a seat at the table and more and more people were able to have some say. We’ve still got more work to do. That’s something that a seven year old, an eight year old, a 10 year old can understand. Part of the job, I think, for an educational curriculum is to give them actual experiences voting. 
It’s interesting. Studies show that people are more likely to vote if they have participated in something like that when they were younger. So finding excuses to say, “Hey, what kind of posters do we want up in the rooms? Here’s some options. Let’s all vote. Here are three books that I want us to read this semester. Which one do you all want to read first?” Giving kids a sense that they have a voice, that peaks their interest. 
We teach kids the opposite, which is, “Just do what I told you to do. Shut up. I don’t have to explain why. That’s how we’re going to do it.” Well, if that’s our message, then that carries over to when they’re adults, and they start thinking, “Well, I have no say over this. I have no power over this.” I think as much as what the curriculum is, creating models to give young people experiences. It doesn’t have to be student council or something, because I wasn’t a member of student council. I had those distractions I was talking about. Although I’m very proud of young people who are part of student councils. But creating opportunities for young people to collectively make decisions and to see that the decisions they make then create results and have consequences, that’s, I think more than anything, what we want to teach people. 
So much of our world is designed to teach people to just consume and watch and eat and just lay back instead of teaching them to produce and make and create. We do that across the board. That’s why when I see schools that eliminate art programming or music programs, that’s a terrible thing. Because one of the things about programs like that is they spur people to think, “I don’t just have to listen to music, I can make music. I don’t have to just go to a museum, and that’s art.” No, art is me drawing something. 
The same is true when it comes to civic involvement. It’s like show them that they can do it, and give them examples of it. That requires us to have faith in our young people. You know what? I think so often, particularly in communities where we’re hurting, that we want to protect them, but then what that means is we make them afraid of everything. What we want to do is just say, “No, no, no, the world is there for you to shape,” and give them opportunities, even in small ways, to do that. When that happens, you’ll be surprised. They will rise to the challenge. All right? Well, listen, I appreciate all you guys. I got to get out of here. I got to go do a rally."
27,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-jacksonville-fl-october-19,"Kamala Harris Campaign Speech Transcript Jacksonville, FL October 19","Hello everybody. Oh, it’s wonderful to be in Jacksonville. [inaudible 00:00:26] Ms. Riley, you are amazing. Thank you for sharing the stage and for all of your leadership and all your work. Congressman Lawson, he is a force. Let me tell you something. Thank you for sending him to DC because I’ve seen him in rooms when the cameras are on, I’ve seen him in rooms when the cameras are off, he is always fighting, always fighting for Florida. So can we please hear it for Congressman Lawson? 
All right. Who voted today? There we go. I came to Florida today to help kick off early voting. And I came to thank you, everybody here, for all that you are doing. Let me tell you something. The voters of Florida, you guys are going to determine the outcome of this election. I’m sure of it. You will determine the outcome of this election. The votes that you are going to cast, the votes that you have cast, the folks that you get to go vote between today, and let’s remind everybody to vote early between today and Sunday, November 1st are going to have an impact on people you may never meet. People who may never know your name, but because you here in Florida voted in your numbers, voted with your voice and the power of your voice, you will very likely determine the outcome of this election. 
And so I am here on behalf of Joe Biden and myself to say thank you. To say thank you. And look, I don’t have to tell everybody here. There is so much at stake in this election. There is so much at stake. Who watched the debate? Well, we’ve actually had two, I guess, huh? And we’ve had two debates, but I really meant that town hall. Did you all see Joe Biden in that town hall? Wasn’t he spectacular? In this election, folks have got two choices. And I think that what we saw in those town halls last week really made clear that there is a distinct difference between the two choices being presented to the American people. 
On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is dedicated to building on the success that he and President Barack Obama created with the Affordable Care Act, which brought healthcare at over 20 million people, and initiative that was born out of an understanding and belief that the access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. The Affordable Care Act, which said it’s not right. It just ain’t right when people who have preexisting conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, breast cancer, that they’d be denied coverage because an insurance company says, “Oh, we don’t cover if you have a preexisting condition.” And they got rid of that ban and they said, “No longer can you deny people access to healthcare if they have a preexisting condition.” 
Joe Biden has been fighting for working people his entire life. And on the other hand, you have Donald Trump who right now with his boy Bill Barr is in the United States Supreme Court trying to sue against the Affordable Care Act. And if they are successful, they will get rid of coverage that came to over 20 million people. They will lose, and lose the protections for all of the people who need coverage if they have preexisting conditions. This is what they’re up to. And it is shameful. And it is shameful. 
There is a clear contrast here. On the one hand, you have Joe Biden, who is saying, “We’re going to have middle-class tax cuts.” Taxes will not be raised on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who passed a tax bill benefiting the top 1% in the biggest corporations of America. And Florida, you know that right now people are hurting. People are suffering. In Florida right now, one in eight Floridians is describing members of their household as being hungry. We’re in the midst of a hunger crisis in America. In Florida, right now, one in five Floridians is describing themselves being unable to pay their rent in September. But yet this man, Donald Trump, would like you to believe everything is okay because, you see, his measure of the success of the economy is based on the stock market. Our measure is based on how working people are doing. And how are you doing? 
So we got a lot of work to do. We got a lot of work to do when we think about the fact that we’re all wearing masks. The only reason I’m not wearing one at the moment is because I’m this far away from everybody. Why are we wearing masks? Because we’re in the midst of a pandemic. Well, let’s remember the history, the recent history on this. Thanks to Bob Woodward, we know Donald Trump was informed in January, January 28th of the nature of this pandemic. He was informed that it was lethal in proportion, it would kill five times as many people as the flu. He was informed it could hurt children. He was informed that it was contagious and air bound. 
And what did he do? He stood at rallies and he stood before the American people and he didn’t tell you what he knew. Imagine folks, if you knew on January 28th what he knew on January 28th, and what you might’ve done or been able to do to protect your family, to protect your children, knowing that it is inevitable that maybe there might have to be some time that people have to stay home from work. And perhaps you could have planned for that. But instead, he held onto that information. He covered it up. And then he told the people, us, we the people, well, you’re on one side of his ledger, if you don’t wear a mask, you’re on another side of his ledger if he wears a mask. What’s that about? 
And see, this is the difference between a Donald Trump and a Joe Biden, because Joe Biden stands for the people, with the people. He knows that this election will be conducted by the people. And so that’s what’s ahead of us. What is ahead of us is to fight, is to fight knowing that we don’t want a president of the United States who spends full time trying to sow hate and division between us. That’s not who we are. We know that in the beauty of the diversity of who we are, the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And we’re here right now, standing in the rain because we know we are better than this. And we know that the strength of our democracy is in the strength of the people and that the people are prepared to fight for their country based on our love of our country. We will fight for our country. 
And that’s what this election is about. Here in Florida, with the exception of some of the great members of Congress and some of the mayors and all the folks, I also know you got some other folks who were elected in Florida. I’m not going to mention any names, but here’s the thing, all over this country, people are trying, including this president, to suggest to you that you can’t trust our election system. They’re trying to confuse folks about voting. They’re trying to suggest that there is somehow, there is something that lacks integrity about our system, because you see, they’re trying to confuse folks about your power to vote. They’re trying to confuse folks about how to vote, but we’re smarter than that. And we know the power that we have when we vote. 
And here’s the point that I want to make. Sometimes not only do we have to sit back and know that we’ve got to vote to honor all of the ancestors who fought for our right to vote. People like the late great John Lewis. We know that we need to vote to honor. We just honored the hundredth anniversary of the 19th Amendment, all those suffragettes who fought for the right for women to vote. We also fight for all of those who understood black women didn’t get to vote until 1965. 
We honor the ancestors, but we also do as we know this, and this is what I want to ask you and then I’m going to close my comments because I want you to get out of the rain. I’m going to leave you with this. We have to ask, and please get back in your cars, get in your cars. I’ll talk louder. Here’s the thing. When all these people all over the country, all these powerful people trying to put roadblocks in, right? They’ve been picking up the drop boxes, right, so people find it hard to find where the drop box is to early vote. They’ve been trying to suppress the vote. They’ve been purging the voter rules. And you have to sit back and ask why are these powerful people trying to make it so difficult for us to vote? And here is the answer: Because they know our power. They know when we vote, we win. 
They know when we vote that we vote for justice, we vote for fairness. They know we know what’s on the ballot in 2020. Justice is on the ballot in 2020. Economic justice is on the ballot in 2020. Criminal justice reform is on the ballot in 2020. Reproductive justice is on the ballot in 2020. Climate justice is on the ballot in 2020. We know what we have at stake and we know our power and that’s why we will vote every day until election day and get this thing done. Thank you."
28,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/kamala-harris-campaign-speech-transcript-orlando-fl-october-19,"Kamala Harris Campaign Speech Transcript Orlando, FL October 19","What’s up, Florida? Orlando. Oh, oh. Oh, look at what my eyes behold. Today, I had to come here on the kickoff of early voting in Florida, because you all are going to make it happen. You will make it happen. 
What you will do here in Florida, in Orlando, what you will do by early voting is you will be the first to put our country back on the right track. It is you. You will do that. You will do that. Who’s voted already? All right. 
You will be the first, and you have been the first. And I am so happy to be back in Florida. I am so happy to be back in Orlando. And I cannot thank you, because as Val Demings said, there is so much on the ballot in 2020. Justice is on the ballot in 2020. Economic justice is on the ballot in 2020. Climate justice is on the ballot in 2020. Health care justice is on the ballot in 2020. Reproductive justice is on the ballot in 2020. Criminal justice reform is on the ballot in 2020. Climate reform is on the ballot in 2020. Everything is on the ballot in 2020. Joe Biden is on the ballot in 2020. 
And we are going to get this done. And we’re going to get it done. We’re going to get it done. And I don’t need to tell everybody here what’s at stake. There’s so much at stake. Here in Florida, already you all know. One in eight Floridians describe their household as being hungry in September. One in eight. One in five Floridians described that they couldn’t pay the rent in the month of September. 
And let’s think about how we got here. I don’t know if you all saw that debate that we did a couple of weeks ago, but Joe’s been on the stage debating. We have another debate coming up. He did an amazing job at the town hall. Did you all watch that? Right? It was a true exercise in contrast. 
So what we know is this. Back in January, the current occupant of the White House knew. He had inside information. He knew that this virus was five times more deadly than the flu. He knew it would impact children of America. He knew it was airborne. But what’d he do? He kept that information to himself. I call it a coverup. 
He didn’t let you know on January 28th what he knew on January 28th. Can you imagine if you all knew, if we knew on January 28th what he knew? Can you imagine what parents and families and each of us might’ve been able to do to prepare for this? If we had known it was airborne, what we might’ve done in the spirit reverend of love thy neighbor to make sure we all wore masks every day. What folks might’ve been able to do, knowing already in our country that in 99% of the counties in America, before the pandemic, if you are a minimum wage worker working full-time, you couldn’t afford market rate for a one-bedroom apartment, what America would have done to prepare for the inevitability that businesses might shut down, to prepare, because in Trump’s America, it will not be the case in Joe Biden’s America, that folks who are working without paid family leave, without paid sick leave, what people might’ve done to prepare. 
But he didn’t tell the American people. He covered it up. And now, we look at where we are and we are in the midst of four crises happening at the same time in the moment where we are also witnessing the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of America. 
So we are looking at a public health crisis, which I describe as being a crisis of proportion in terms of the loss of life like we have not seen since World War II. Over 215,000, we’re approaching 220,000 human beings, their lives lost. So many who couldn’t even be, because of the nature of the virus, with their families in their last days. We’re looking at over eight million people who contracted the virus. We’re looking at over 30 million people who had to file for unemployment insurance. We’re looking at our children, so many of whom don’t have access to broadband, much less have a laptop, and are trying to now figure out how to get the education that they deserve because of the God-given talent they have and how that should be nurtured. But yet, there is no access and no meaningful access to the education they need. 
These days lost because of this virus that this man had an opportunity to deal with, but denied fact, denied science, and lied to the American people. So we know we need a change, and a change is coming. 
And then, in the middle of it all, you all have been hearing me talking about it. Donald Trump has this weird obsession with trying to get rid of whatever Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. Have you noticed that? It’s this weird obsession, right? Loco. 
And so in the midst of a public health crisis, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, who in their administration created the most extensive public health coverage we’ve ever seen with the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and do you know Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of it with his boy Bill Barr, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act that brought coverage to over 20 million people, that said if you have pre-existing conditions, things like diabetes … Do you know anybody who has diabetes? Pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure, breast cancer, all of these things now covered because of the Affordable Care Act that Barack Obama and Joe Biden created. And Donald Trump is in court trying to sue to get rid of it. 
But we’re not going to let him. We’re not going to let him, because what we know and what Joe knows is access to healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. So we’re going to fight. We’re going to expand Medicare. Joe Biden is going to bring down eligibility for Medicare to age 60. We’re going to bring down prescription drug costs. We are going to preserve social security and the promise we made to our seniors. We’re going to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act to include mental health care, because folks have been traumatized and we’ve got to stop treating healthcare as though the body just starts from the neck down. Let’s deal with healthcare from the neck up. 
These are the things we’re going to do. And by the way, in those debates, as per usual, you can rely on Donald Trump to engage and distortions and basically lie to the American people. So let’s be clear about this. Joe Biden will not increase taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year, period. 
So there are a lot of issues at play, so many issues at play, and there’s so much at stake. And I wanted to come. I just landed. I just landed. This was my first stop today. And I wanted to come here to see you for the kickoff of early voting, to thank you, to thank you, to thank you, because as much as they’ve been trying to destroy our democracy, the one thing I know is that, when the people are prepared to fight for our country based on love of country, they can never do us any harm, because we will stand up and we will march and we will organize and we will vote and we will fight for our country. 
So we know what’s at stake. And so here’s the bottom line. In Florida, I know what’s going on here. I’ve been reading about it and hearing about it. You all have been telling me about it. Aside from the incredible leadership that you’ve got in Congressman Val Demings and, of course, Stephanie Murphy and Senator Bill Nelson, who was a great friend, I know you got some other elected officials in this state, too, that aren’t doing necessarily what’s in the best interest of all the people. 
And so I want to say this. When we see examples of people trying to make it difficult for folks to vote … And it’s happening all over the country, people trying to suppress the vote, Donald Trump trying to confuse people about the integrity of our voting system, trying to suggest that you can’t trust it. Right? 
But we know better. And we know when somebody is trying to play us. We know when someone, see, is trying to pull the wool over our eyes, trying to discourage us, trying to deflate our enthusiasm, trying to suggest to us that we don’t matter. We can see that. We know that. That’s not new to us. 
And in the face of these moments, we ask ourselves then a question. Why are so many powerful people trying to get in the way of us voting? Why are these powerful people trying to suggest we can’t trust the system, putting in place laws that are designed to suppress the vote, trying to purge the voter roles, trying to make it difficult? Why are they doing that? 
And the answer, of course, we know is this. Because they know when we vote, we win. When we vote, we change things. We make it better. We know our power. We know our power. They know our power. They know our power, and we know our power. And that’s why we’re all here today, because we know our power and we know we will never let anybody take our power from us. Never. 
And so that’s why we’re all here today, to say, “We are powerful, we are strong, we stand together in unity, we stand here as a coalition of people that represent the beautiful diversity of who we are as a country.” And we know that when we vote and when we use our voice, we win. We know our country is worth it. We know and can see a better day. And so let’s get out there and organize, folks, and make sure everybody votes. And we will win. 
Thank you, Florida. Thank you. Thank you."
29,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-north-carolina-speech-transcript-october-18,Joe Biden North Carolina Speech Transcript October 18,"I tell you what. Thanks for sharing your story and it’s what this country’s all about. You’re making your family proud, man. And I wanted to talk, I want to thank the speakers ahead of me. Commissioner, soon to be commissioner Jessica Holmes, where are you Jessica? I know you’re here somewhere. And also state Representative Yvonne Holly, Lewis-Holley. She’s here. Zach Hawkins. Folks, and a great coach, Coach Lawson. 
I tell you what. My granddaughter’s with me today. And she went to a school that Coach Lawson went to for a little while in Washington. And apparently Coach telling me she’s recruiting some of the girl’s basketball team from where my granddaughter went to school. And she showed me Coach, she showed me a video you were doing for your team, where you made the distinction between competing and winning, the heart of winning and competing. And you talked about, though, working hard and competing. And everybody you pointed out works hard. But you said working hard is absolutely essential, but competing is even more consequential. You can work hard, but did you compete with everything you had? Competing because you know what’s at stake, what is at the heart of winning. 
My good friends, Congressman, excuse me, G.K. Butterfield and David Price, who represent the first and fourth districts with decency and honor, they can tell you we’re doing both, working hard and we’re competing like we never did before because so much is at stake for this nation. The very soul of the nation is at stake. Folks, as my coaches used to say in college, it’s go time. It’s the most important election in our lifetimes. We’re going to make all the difference here in North Carolina. The choice is clear as it’s ever been. And the stakes have never been higher. The stakes of this election, remind me of something my dad used to say when he lost job up in Scranton, Pennsylvania when I was a kid, when coal died and he moved down to Delaware. He used to always say, “Joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.- 
“It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” Then he said, it’s the God’s truth, if I heard it once I heard it 20 times. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” That’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I grew up surrounded by a lot of hard work and folks in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware were we moved. How many people today though, think they can look their kid in the eye right now and say, “It’s going to be okay,” and mean it. So many people are hurting. Over half the people in America say if they got a bill for $400 they didn’t expect in one month, they wouldn’t be able to pay it. They’d have to borrow the money or they’d have to sell something. 
Folks, times are hard, unemployment’s way up. Just this week, 1,200,000 people filed for unemployment. Folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or rent payment. Whether their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic. Worried about sending their kids to school, worried about not sending their kids to school. They see folks at the top, they’re doing better than ever while they’re left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me.” 
Well, that’s Donald Trump’s presidency. More than 217,000 Americans dead because of COVID-19. Nearly 4,000 here in the state of North Carolina. On Friday, we saw the highest number of new cases in one day since July. In the last two days, worst day since July. Yet, the other night Trump said in one of his rallies, “We’ve turned the corner.” And my grandfather would say, “This guy’s gone around the bend if he thinks we turned the corner,” 
Turn the corner? Things are getting worse. He continues to lie to us about the circumstances. Experts say we’re likely to lose as many as 200,000 additional lives nationwide between now and the end of the year. All because this President cares more about his Park Avenue perspective on the world, the stock market, than he does about you. Because he refuses to follow the science. It’s estimated that if we just wore masks, if we just wore masks, we’d save between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives. His own head of the CDC said that. And you know what? What’s really sad about this? The President knew how dangerous this virus was all the way back in January. 
And he hid it from the country. He’s on record. He told Bob Woodward in a taped interview that the disease was deadly, much worse than the flu. And here’s what he did. According to the New York Times three, four days ago, his Administration gave Wall Street investors, a head’s up, but he didn’t tell us, just his friends on Wall Street. That’s why they made so much money by “selling short.” Well who got sold short, y’all got sell short. And you know what’s coming. 
But what happened to the rest of us? He tried to claim with Woodward, he didn’t want to panic the American people. The American people do not panic, Trump panicked. 
And his selfish behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line for this nation, like so many tens of thousands here in North Carolina have done. Like my son Beau did after a year in Iraq, winning the Bronze Star, conspicuous service medal, he looks at them, he calls them suckers and losers. Who the hell does he think he’s talking about? These are our heroes. They are the people who have sacrificed. They’re the backbone of this country. 
And now as a consequence of all this overwhelming lying, negligent, and irresponsible action has come, how many chairs were empty at the dining room table last night because of his negligence? Folks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have enormous opportunity if we just build. We can build back better. We just got to stand up and take it back. Look, we can build an economy that gets everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, the communities of color here in North Carolina and across the country. The question is, how do we break that cycle where in good times you lag behind. In bad times, you get hit the hardest and first. And in recovery, the last to bounce back. Well, the answer is about justice, criminal justice, police reform. I know this nation is strong enough to do both, honestly face systemic racism and provide safe streets for our families and small businesses, that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. 
We have no need for our armed militias roaming America’s streets. This is the United States of America. And we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group marching, menacing our communities. But what, but if you say we have no need face racial injustice in this country, as he says, you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth. There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent months. George Floyd’s six year old daughter, who I met with in the family. I knelt down to say hi to her. And she looked at me, she said, “Mr. Vice President, daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.” Jacob Blake’s mother, with whom I met, said violence didn’t her son and this nation needs healing. And then said she prayed for the police officers. 
Doc Rivers, a basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.” Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a Black person to love this country today as it does, its deep love for this country. And for much too long it hadn’t been recognized. 
We need leadership to deescalate tensions, open lines of communication and brings us together. To heal and to hope. As president that’s precisely what I’ll do. But true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability. It was right here in Durham, on Parrish Street a century ago that an oasis of black owned businesses thrived, even in the era of Jim Crow. Parrish Street was one of the first examples of flourishing black middle-class community in America. A place that offered the country a glimpse of what we could become if we chose to live up to our founding values. Giving families of color a real shot at a home, start a small business, send a child to college debt free so they can build wealth and pass opportunity down through generations. That’s what built every other middle-class group in America. That’s how we deliver equality and equity. 
Another example, more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession, whether in cities or in suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic. Responsibly testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing a race for a vaccine, planning for its safe and equitable distribution. Providing funding for PPE and other resources for schools to reopen safely. Easing the caregiving crisis so many families are experiencing, squeezed between raising your kids and caring for an aging, loved one. And protecting your health care. In the middle of this pandemic, why did Republicans have the time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of addressing this significant economic needs of local communities? 
I’ll tell you why. For real not hyperbole, I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping Obamacare off the books. That’s what it’s about. Because their nominee has said in the past the law should be struck down. If they get their way, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions. Complications of COVID-19, over 7 million people infected will become the next preexisting condition, allowing insurers to jack up your premiums or deny your coverage altogether. And women will again be charged more for their health just because they are women. Folks, we can do so much better. 
I will build on the Affordable Care Act so you can keep your private insurance. You can choose a Medicare like option. We’re going to increase subsidies that lower your premiums and deductibles [inaudible 00:12:18] out of pocket spending. Look, your governor has been working hard to expand Medicaid, but it’s being blocked by Republican legislature. My plan will automatically enroll 357,000 uninsured North Carolinans in a public option for free, automatically. 
And it’s going to make a life-changing difference for so many families. But we can only do any of this if we come together as a country. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the moment I announced, I’m told that, “Well, maybe that’s you used to be able to do that, Joe. That was your reputation when you were in the Senate and Vice President. But things have changed. They don’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can and they will and they must if we’re going to get anything done in America. 
Folks- 
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. No red states, no blue States, just the United States. I promise you. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who did. That’s the job of a president, a duty to care, to care for everyone in America. Folks, and you too have a sacred duty. To vote. And it matters. North Carolina matters. And Senator Harris and I are asking you for your trust and support. We’ll always have your back, I promise you. 
So please, please vote and help get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/nc. Early voting started on Thursday. We got to keep the incredible momentum going. We can’t let up. You can vote early in person until the 31st. But don’t wait, go vote today and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris. You’ve got a governor’s race, a Senate race, a record number of black women on the ballot. Congress and lieutenant governor. Labor commissioner and the courts. Folks, they’re ready to deliver for North Carolina families. So vote, vote. It’s time. It really is time. 
When I announced my candidacy, I hadn’t planned on running again to be very blunt. And I’ve said it before. My son had just died and I had no interest. And then I saw those folks coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, carrying torches. Close your eyes, remember what it looked like. They’re veins bulging, shouting anti-Semitic bile. The same bile that was shouted in the streets of Germany in the thirties. Carrying Nazi flags, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan. And a young woman was killed that was protesting the opposite direction. And when asked to comment, this President said something no other president has ever said in the history of the United States of America. He said, “There were very fine people on both sides. Very fine people.” 
Folks, I mean it when I say this it’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. And this time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your religion, your gender, ethnicity, or disability. We can do this. The blinders have been taken off the American people and they’ve seen what’s happened. It’s time to unite America. Look, I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said when I was a kid and we’re going to the moon. Every kid in the school had to hear his speech. He used the line in that speech my Senate colleagues and the White House heard me use all the time, it made the most impression on me. He asked the unasked question, “Why are we doing this?” And his response was, he said, “Because we refuse to postpone.” 
This is America. We refuse to postpone America’s work that must be done. 
There’s nothing beyond our capacity. We have never, never, never, never failed. There’s no limit on our future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. So let’s let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. We choose unity over division. Science over fiction. And yes, we choose truth over lies. So folks, it’s time to stand up. Stand up and take back our democracy. No more time left. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

I’m a car guy and I got a ’67 Corvette that’s Goodwood green. That’s a 60… That’s not a 67. That’s a 427. That thing gets up and goes. Anyway. Choir, you must be freezing. Freezing to death. Well, I tell you what, man, you ought to huddle on the bus or something. Folks, I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you being here. What time is it now? Seven o’clock at night, cold as the devil and your here. And I thank you very, very much. Detroit, there’s no better, no more appropriate place to hold a drive-in rally than in motor city USA. 
I want to thank Everett. I want to thank Everett for sharing his story with us and for the unfailing dedication that you and so many of your proud union educators, we owe you. We owe you big for those students and families you take care of during these difficult times. I’m married. I’m Jill Biden’s husband. She’s an educator. So, that’s what teaching is. It’s just not she does. It’s who she is. So Everett, thank you. And folks, look. I also want to thank the incredible leaders who are here today. My good friend, Mayor Duggan and mayor Duggan and I spent an awful lot of time together trying to get Detroit back. He got it back on the upside, but I was here trying to get to all the help he could possibly get to get it done. As Vice President I’m fighting to support this city, invest in the revitalization of the future of Detroit, because I’ve always believed in Detroit, not just saying that. My dad was an automobile man. 
That’s what got me through school. That’s what everything was about. And I’ve always believed in Michigan. We have the finest auto workers in the world here in Michigan. That’s not hyperbole. That’s a fact. I want to thank you, Chairwoman Barnes. Thank you very, very much. And Lieutenant Governor Gilchrist, you’ve been a good friend. And Governor Whitmer, you’ve been an incredible leader. She’s been tested and proven under crisis conditions and extraordinary circumstances. 
Your leadership through this pandemic has saved countless lives of Michiganders here, Gov. That’s a fact. And you’ve shown the whole nation just how tough you are. Michigan tough. I’m proud to call you a friend. And Senator Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, thank you for fighting for the people of Michigan who need help now, but aren’t getting it because the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, cares more about shoving through our Supreme Court nomination to take away your health care than he does helping the hurting people in this city, this state in this country. We can’t forget that winning in November doesn’t just mean defeating Donald Trump. It means winning back the United States Senate and expanding our majority in the House of Representatives. That’s why we need to send Gary back to Washington, DC. 
I really mean it. We need him. That’s the guy who knows what he believes and says what he believes and does what he believes. And alongside Debbie Stabenow for the people in Michigan, but not quite frankly for the whole country. Folks, as my coaches to say, it’s go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes. And you can make all the different here in Michigan. The choice is as clear as ever, and the stakes are higher than ever. The stakes in this election remind me of something my dad used to say. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in your communities. Be able to look your child in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.” Well, that’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. 
That’s what I grew up surrounded by, hard work and families. In Scranton, Pennsylvania. Claymont, Delaware. How many people today though, can look their kids in the eye and say, “Everything’s going to be all right,” and mean it? These times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. Just this week, over a million, 200,000 more people file for unemployment. The economic outlook for next year remains uncertain and across Michigan and the country, folks are worried about making their next rent payment or their mortgage payment or their car payment. They’re worried whether or not they can purchase the prescription drug they need or put food on the table, have to make a choice. Worried about sending their kids to school or worried about not sending their kids to school. They see the people at the top doing a hell of a lot better while the rest are left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presidency. 
More than 215… I think it’s now 217,000, dead Americans because of COVID-19. And experts say we’ll lose nearly 200,000 more lives in the next few months, all because this President cares more about his Park Avenue perspective on the world and the stock market than he does about you. Because we refuse to follow the science. It’s estimated if we just wore these masks between now and the end of the year, we’d save 100,000 lives. Folks, you know what’s really sad about all this? The President knew. He knew back in January how dangerous this virus was. 
And he hid it from the American people. He told the journalist Bob Woodward in a taped interview the disease was deadly. In January. Deadly and far worse than the flu and airborne. But here’s what he did. According to the New York Times today, his administration gave Wall Street investors a heads up about it. Didn’t tell us, but gave Wall Street Investors a head up, but the American people, he said nothing. That’s why they made so much money by quote, “Selling short.” They knew what was coming. But what happened to the rest of us? He told Bob Woodward he didn’t want to panic the American people. We don’t panic. He panicked. 
This personal conduct since his diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the leading expert in the country, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, as quote, “A super spreader event causing so many people to get COVID.” And how did Trump respond? He responded by running a national ad, taking Dr. Fauci’s words out of context. 
Dr. Fauci said way back in March a quote, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more.” Referring to the public health officials. Then Trump took that quote out of context and put it into a campaign ad deliberately lying, making a sound like Dr. Fauci was talking about him. Even after Fauci asked him to take the ad down, trump’s campaign said they’d continue to use the ad, knowing it was a lie. That behavior is no surprise. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line, like my son put the lives on the line to save our nation, calls them losers and suckers. My son Beau spent a year in Iraq, won the bronze star of the conspicuous service medal. He was no sucker. 
And the people he left behind were heroes. And now, as a consequence of this overwhelming lying, misleading irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are there going to be around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? Folks, we’re so much better than this as a country. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity to build back better. The American people have had the blinders off to replace Donald Trump’s incentives for companies to ship jobs overseas, with rental policies and tax credits, to revitalize American manufacturing, to make it in America, make it in Michigan, buy American. 
Look. We’re going to do everything to give everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, in communities of color here in Detroit and all across the country, the question is, “How do we break the cycle?” Where in good times, you lag behind. In bad times, you’re the first hit and hit the hardest. And in recovery, you’re the last ones the bounce back. The answer is about justice. Criminal justice, policing reform. This nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to ride safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacist group, menacing our country. These guys are hatching violent and deranged schemes, like the one against Governor Whitmer that the FBI and local law enforcement uncovered and stopped last week. But make no mistake, that was a planned act of terrorism. 
A plot. Think of this. A plot in the United States of America to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an American leader. That’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS that should shock the conscience of every American to see that sort of twisted thinking take root here in America. What all President does, Trump does, is fan the flames of hatred and division in this country. Telling the proud boys in the debate with me. When I said, “Will you condemn them? He said, “I’ll tell them to stand back and stand by.” What the hell’s the matter with this guy? Attacking Governor Whitmer on the same day this plot was exposed. It’s despicable. And by the same measure, if you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country, you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth of America today. 
There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. George Floyd’s six year old daughter, who I met with when I met the family. Jean. I knelt down to say hi to her, and looked at me and said, “Daddy, change the world.” Jacob Blake’s mother, another one, when I met with her, said violence doesn’t reflect who her son is and the nation needs healing and said she’s praying for the police officers. Or [Doc Rivers 00:12:02], the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, quote, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’d been hung. It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.” 
Think about that. Think about what it takes to be a black person who loves America today. That is a deep love of this country that has far too long, has not been fully recognized. What we need in America us leadership to seek to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communications, to bring us back together again, to heal, to hope. As President that’s precisely what I’ll do, but true justice is also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth, passing it down. 
That’s how I deliver equality and equity. Another example, more and more women are dropping out of the workplace because of the recession or in a city or out in the suburbs. I have a plan to deal with the pandemic responsibly. New testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing the race for vaccine. Planning for safe and equitable distribution, providing PPE and other resources for schools to reopen safely. Ease the caregiving crisis that so many families are experiencing. Squeezed between raising your kid and caring for your aging loved ones. And protect your health care. In the middle of this pandemic why didn’t Republicans have the time, as I said, to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court, instead of addressing the significant economic needs of local communities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping out Obamacare. Wiping it off the books, because their nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. 
He’s going to take away healthcare coverage for 20 million Americans. They’ll also take away protections for preexisting conditions that more than a hundred million people in America have. Complications of COVID-19 will also add to that. Lung scarring, heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. That will toss out the rule that allows children to be covered on their parents’ health insurance till age 26. Will take us backwards to when insurance companies could charge a woman more for healthcare than a man, just because she’s a woman. Folks, we can do so much better together. I’ll build on the Affordable Care act, where you can choose to keep your private insurance as well as offer Medicaid like public option, which will give private insurance real competition. We’re going to increase subsidies so your premiums are lower. You can afford a plan with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending. 
Folks, we can only do this if we come together as a country. Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. And instead of healing, we’re being ripped apart. I refuse to let that happen. We need to revive a spirit of bipartisan in this country. A spirit of being able to work with another. When I say that I’m told that used to be the way, Joe, used to get a lot of things done, but things have changed. Well, I’m here to tell you it can happen again. And they must. It must if we’re ever going to get anything done. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American President. 
I work with Democrats and Republicans. That’s why so many Republican leaders have endorsed me. They know I’ve done it and we’ll do it again. For those who don’t support me as well as those who do, folks that’s the job of a President, the duty to care, the duty to heal. And you, too, have a sacred duty. As my friend, John Lewis used to say, “Vote. It matters.” Michigan matters. You elected me and Barack Obama in 2012. And you bet on us when we bet on you and bet on American workers. We bet on the UAW. I’m asking for your trust and support in 2020 for Kamala and me. We’ll always have your back. I promise you. So please, vote. Help us get out the vote. Go to iwillvote.com/mi and Detroit, more than 20 years. Look, you have now 20 early voting centers. They’re open now all across the city. 
Open seven days a week and election day. It’s a one-stop shop. You can go get registered and vote right then and there. So don’t wait. Vote today. Tell everyone you know. Everyone you meet, vote. Vote. Vote. And no matter what, don’t let anybody discourage you or tell you your vote won’t count because it does. 
You, the American people are going to decide the future of this country. Vote. It’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country. The middle class and unions built the middle class. No matter what your age, race, or gender. Folks, folks, look. It’s time to unite America. It really is. 
I’ll never forget what President Kennedy said about going to the moon. My colleagues in the Senate used to kid me by raising it when I’d bring it up in a caucus. He answered the question that was on everybody’s lips but nobody asked. “Why are we doing this?” He said, “We’re doing it because we refuse to postpone.” I refuse to postpone any longer the work America must do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to America’s future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. Look, everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Let’s show them who we are. We choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. It’s time to stand up, take back our country. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Go get him. We can do this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
31,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-southfield-mi-speech-on-health-care-october-16,"Joe Biden Southfield, MI Speech on Health Care October 16","Hello, Michigan. Hi, how are you? What’s your name? Sam, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here. I appreciate it. Alexia, thank you for taking the time telling your story, it’s important. Unfortunately, there are an awful lot of stories like yours all over America as I travel the country, too many, it don’t have to be. And, folks, it’s great to be back, it’s great to be here. 
There’s not a better governor in the United States of America than Gretchen Whitmer, that’s a fact. I’ve met virtually all of them. And Gary, we badly need you back in the United States Senate, pal, we badly need you back in the United States Senate. And then my sister, Debbie Stabenow. God love you, Debbie. We worked so closely together for so long and as vice-president as well. 
Folks, look, we need to send Gary back to another term. Standing up for Michigan, Michigan families, small businesses. He was our main congressional partner back in 2010 when we passed the critical legislation supporting small businesses. I remember the president gave me the responsibility to go out and round up support. My go-to guy to get it done, I mean it sincerely was Gary. He was the go-to guy and he always shows up and he always shows up for Michigan. 
And like all of you, Jill and I are so grateful that the governor and her family are safe. It’s an unusual year. Governor you’ve been through a lot but my Lord, you are a leader. You stand up straight and tall and you don’t bend. Governor, it’s not easy to lead in moments of crisis but that’s a determination of whether you are a real leader when you stepped up to the crisis and you’ve stepped up, you’ve done it and you keep doing it. 
And as I said a moment ago you’re pretty much doing it better than anybody else in the whole United States of America. You’ve shown this whole nation just how tough and thoughtful you are, tough just like Michigan. I’ve got to believe this state has to be so proud of you. I know personally I am as I’ve gotten to know you and proud to call your friend, gov. 
We’re grateful to the FBI and law enforcement to discover these domestic terrorists and stop them. And make no mistake, that’s who they are, domestic terrorists, flat terrorists. Planning to blow up a bridge on American soil, to threaten the lives of police officers, to kidnap an elected later and now we’re finding out the same thing was happening in Virginia. It’s the sort of behavior you might expect from ISIS and it should shock the conscious of every American, every American. And the failure to condemn these folks is stunning from the outset. I remember it matters. You’ve heard me say it before, “Words matter.” And the words of a president particularly matter. When the president tweeted, “Liberate Michigan, liberate Michigan,” that’s the call that was heard, that was the dog whistle. Just like when he said, “Very fine people on both sides in Charlottesville.” Fathers, they came out of the fields carrying torches, their veins bulging, shouting antisemitic bile, carrying Nazi flags accompanied by the Klu Klux Klan. 
But when a young woman was killed protesting the president was asked what he think and he said something no president has ever, ever, ever, ever heard, “There were very fine people on both sides.” Those words were heard just like when he stood on the debate stage with me and refused to denounce white supremacists but told that white ring extremist group to “stand back and stand by.” Stand back and stand by, an American president? Not only shocked us but it stunned the world. Those words we heard. 
You know the reason I decided to run for president and I know that Debbie knows this. I hadn’t planned on running ever again after my son died. But when I saw those folks coming out of those woods I thought, “How in God’s name, how in God’s name can I remain silent?” And I said at the time it was somewhat not criticized but people didn’t think it was… Well, I don’t know what it was. When I said, “I think we’re in a battle for the soul of America,” I think we are. 
What I saw at Charlottesville and the president’s response to it is why I went to Gettysburg Battlefield of Pennsylvania last week. Because I thought there was need to stand up to hate in America and urge as Lincoln did to come together as a nation. Well, I’ve learned hate never goes away, it only hides. It never goes away, and if you’re given oxygen it comes out from one of the rocks, it grows. We need to be clear from the president going down in this country, there is no place for hate in America, period, none, it will not be tolerated. 
But President Trump revels in division and chaos to do anything to distract us from focusing on his failures to deal with this virus and to protect the nation. He’s still living in a dream world. He keeps telling us that this virus is going to disappear like America. He said, I think last night in his town hall, I didn’t have the pleasure of hearing it, I was doing one myself. He said, “We have turned the corner.” And my grandfather was sitting in my chair where he said, “He’s gone around the bunny.” 
Turned the corner? My Lord. It’s not disappearing, in fact it’s on the rise again. It’s getting worse as predicted. And we all know the terrible price this nation has paid. Lives lost, unemployment way up, across Michigan and the country folks are worried about making their next rent payment and mortgage payment. Or their healthcare will be ripped away in the middle of a pandemic that you worked so damn hard, Gary, to keep. Worried about… 
And we talked about this, Alexia. Kids in school, are they able to get back to school? More than 215,000 Americans, I think it’s 217 as of this morning, Americans have died from COVID-19. And experts have said, and I’ve been saying for the last month and a half that nearly another 200,000 lives are likely to be lost in the coming months between now and the first of the year if we continue to refuse to follow science. Because he refused to embracing wearing a mask, how many times on television have you seen him make fun of Biden wearing a mask? Because he refuses to practice social distancing he puts his supporters in such jeopardy. It’s estimated… 
It’s estimated by his own folks, if we just wore masks nationally, almost 100,000 lives would be saved in the next few months. His own director of CDC said while we’re waiting for a vaccine, even if we had a vaccine, this will prevent more deaths between now and the end of January than a vaccine would. Know what’s really sad about all this? And I’ve been talking about this, but every time I repeat it, I get more… Well, I’m not very happy. 
The president knew and lied about knowing. He knew in January. The intelligence community and what they call the PDB, the Presidential Daily Briefings, which I’ve sat in on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them as vice-president. It got out that they laid out in detail to him how devastating this could be, how much life could be lost, and so on. He said he was unaware of it. Didn’t read those reports. Well, that surprised no one, he didn’t read the reports, but he didn’t read the reports. And everybody said, “Well, maybe he didn’t.” 
But then as was acknowledged because of his ego, he wanted to impress a famous journalist, he thought he could change his mind about his view of him, he did a long interview with Bob Woodward. Bob Woodward, a renowned journalist, taped the interview with him, extensive interviews, hours. And he taped an interview where Trump said he knew this disease was deadly, significantly worse than the flu. But that’s not what he told you. That’s not what he told the public. 
And the reason he lied again to the American people? Well, he said he didn’t want to panic the American people. Americans don’t panic. Donald Trump panicked. That’s who panicked. As a consequence of his overwhelming lying, negligence, and irresponsible action, how many empty chairs were around the kitchen table this morning or the dining room table last night? How many? How many women or men leaned over when they got in bed last night and reached over to touch their husband and wife, and they weren’t there? You all know what loss is. It’s profound, especially when it was avoidable, much of it. 
But mishandling the pandemic isn’t enough for Trump. On top of that, he’s still trying to take away your healthcare. Trump’s still determined in the midst of this pandemic. And by the way, if projections… Pray, God, they’re not right, Father. But if they’re right, though, in the next several months, there’ll be over 200,000 additional deaths. That would be in one year 400,000 Americans would have died. That’s more than lost in all of World War II, hear me? World War II was four years. More American souls would have been lost than in World War II. 
What’s he doing? He’s still determined to destroy the Affordable Care Act. This isn’t hyperbole. Just like your opponent calls it a disaster. Talk about a disaster, there’s a disaster. The guy is 2000% or 200%, whatever it is with Trump. Hope everybody remembers. Look, as I said, this isn’t hyperbole. It’s real, as real as it gets. On November 10th the United States Supreme Court will hear the Trump administration make the case that the Affordable Care Act should be struck down in its entirety. 
I know everybody thinks they know, but I just want to remind you 10 million of you have already lost your health insurance because your employer’s health insurance, they’ve gone out of business. 10 million Americans already without health insurance. If Trump gets his way, 20 million more Americans will lose their health care. That’s God awful. In the midst of this God awful economic crisis, 100 million Americans will lose their protections for pre-existing conditions, including more than 4 million people right here in Michigan. Lifetime limits on benefits will be back. 
And by the way, a lot of you’ve been through what I’ve been through and worse. I can distinctly remember sitting on a bed with my Beau, my son, who came back from a year serving in Iraq, which this president talks about losers who serve, losers. With the same significant disease that your mom had, stage four glioblastoma. When it was diagnosed, when he got home, we asked the docs. It was only a matter of months, not if, just months. We never gave up hope. I remember watching him on that bed. He made it almost 16 months. 
Toward the end, and this is not about me, it’s about all of you, I consciously thought to myself, what would it feel like if they were able to walk in and say, “Mr Biden, you’ve outrun your insurance coverage. Suffer the last two or three months in pain on your own. Lots of luck.” Because that’s what was happening before. 
Insurers, if they win, and that’s what this court packing going on now is about, insurers will no longer allow you to keep your kids on your policy till age 26 in the middle of this economic crisis. Women, once again, will be charged more for their healthcare just because they’re a woman. Older folks will be able to be charged more. And as the governor said, long-term complications from COVID will become pre-existing conditions, joining asthma, diabetes, even pregnancy is a preexisting condition before. It could allow insurers to jack up your premiums or deny coverage altogether. 
Getting rid of Obamacare is why they’re racing to get this nominee through the Supreme Court. Make no mistake about it. Trump’s made it clear from the beginning, as your opponent has. He wants to get rid of Obamacare in its entirety. And with this nominee, he’s made that incredibly clear, as well. Michigan deserves so much better. Deserves leaders like- 
Michigan deserves so much better, deserves leaders like Gary and Debbie Stabenow, public servants who lead with decency and honor, always look out for your needs, will think about how to ease the burden on your family. 
That’s the sort of leader you’ve got in Gretchen, in Governor Whitmer, as well. When she was in the state senate, she led the charge to secure Obamacare Medicaid expansion for more than 800,000 Michiganders. Think about this now. Some of those States, Republican governors did not expand, even though the federal government was paying for it front end. There’s millions of people have no coverage. 
After we passed Obamacare with the help of Debbie and Gary, Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters, we were able to reduce the uninsured rate by 55% here in Michigan. And if I have the honor of becoming your president, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act, no matter what they do. 
You can choose to keep a private plan, if you still have one. Because some of the private plans negotiated, the UAW owners are good plans. But we’ll also offer you a Medicare like public health insurance option. It’ll force private insurers to keep premiums low and offer better coverage because, for the first time, they’ll have to compete for your business against a public insurer that doesn’t have the profit motive in mind. 
If you choose this public option or a private plan will increase subsidies for your premiums, so that they’re lower. You can afford our plans with lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket spending. An independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. Not a liberal think tank, serious folks looking at this. Here’s the bottom line. My plan lowers healthcare costs and gets universal coverage quickly at a time when Michigan families desperately are going to need that relief and they need it now. Families are reeling right now. They need a lifeline now. I promise you. When I’m president I’ll take care of your health coverage, the same way I would my own family. 
I grew up like a lot of people in this state. In Scranton, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware in a three bedroom, split level home with four kids and a grandpop living with us. I can remember how my dad, when we moved from Scranton for no work, we moved down to Delaware. He stayed with my grandpop for a year, he came home every weekend. Finally got a job. We got an apartment we lived in, and ended up being section eight housing years later, but it was decent. We were happy. 
It took my dad about three years to get a job good enough that he could actually buy a home. And he bought that small home at the time a suburban sprawl was going on. There were 70 homes like it, three and four bedrooms homes. But the walls were thin. I look back and I wonder how my mom and dad did it, come to think of it. I remember one night, my dad, you could hear him restlessly rolling in bed. Our bedroom was next to it. And I asked my mom the next morning, what’s wrong with Dad? She said, “Honey, it’s complicated.” I said, “What’s the matter, Mom?” I was 14 years old. She said, “Well, his company just lost his health insurance. We’re going to be okay, honey.” 
Think of all the people rolling around in bed tonight, tomorrow night, last night. Trump doesn’t see things this way because he only sees the world from a Park Avenue perspective. I’m not being a wise guy, I’m being literal. He can only see from his penthouse, Wall Street. 
I see the world from where I grew up like many of you. I grew up in Scranton, as I said. My mom taught me. My mom had a backbone like a ramrod. My mom taught me. She said, “Joey, look at me, look at me.” Because I used to stutter. She said, “Nobody’s better than you, Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” That’s how I was raised. 
I think you and I, we measure people, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, we measure people on the strength of their character. Honesty, decency, recognizing that some things are bigger than just your self-interest. That’s what America is about. That’s who we are. It’s about family, respect, decency, honor, opportunity. Our families and yours, we weren’t asking for anything. Just a shot, just an even shot. Given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever, ever let their country down. 
That’s what Michigan needs now, a shot to come back strong. That’s what you needed 10 years ago in your automobile industry, the heart and soul of Michigan was on the brink. My state used to be an auto state. Small population, we had the highest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation because we had less than a million people. The largest General Motors and Chrysler plants outside of Michigan. But you all remember like I do. You remember what it was like yesterday. 
When Barack and I decided we had to bet on Michigan, remember all the blow back even from some Democrats. We can’t compete. We bet on auto workers, we bet on the UAW and they came through and it paid off. For real. The industry wasn’t in trouble because of the auto workers, it was in trouble because of management decisions. Over the objective of many, we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving over 1 million jobs by that one deal. 
Don’t ever underestimate the American worker. By contrast on Donald Trump’s watch, we were in a nationwide manufacturing recession before COVID struck. And we’re now down nearly 650,000 manufacturing jobs across the country now. Now, and it’s rising. In fact, Donald Trump will be the first president in modern American history to leave office, God willing, to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he started in office. Last one was Herbert Hoover. For real. 
Folks, we can bring this economy back. I’m positive of it. I’m optimistic about it. We know how to go about doing it. An independent analysis on Wall Street, Moody’s, a well-respected Wall Street firm, has done an in-depth analysis of every aspect of my plan, as well as his. You know what their conclusion was? This is Moody’s, now. That my plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his would, and $1 trillion more in economic growth than the president’s plan, by investing in people. 
By the way, you see these ads here in Michigan, Biden’s going to raise your taxes. Once again, flat, unadulterated lie. No one who makes less than $400,000 a year will pay a penny more. If you make more than that, you’re going to start paying at the rate you paid under the administration of George W. Bush at 39.6%. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the very wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. Trump’s more than $2 trillion tax cut, I’m going to roll back 1.5 trillion of that in the giveaways to the biggest companies in the top 1%. And the money we raise, we’ll invest in working people, in growing the middle class. And this time, make sure we bring everybody along, black, white, Hispanic- 
This time, make sure we bring everybody along. Black, white, Hispanic, disabled. Everyone comes along. Outside economists said my plan will create millions of good paying union jobs in manufacturing. We’re going to invest in building more resilient infrastructure. Remember the president said, “I have an infrastructure plan.” In 2017, and then 2018 and 2019, now 2020. He doesn’t have any plan. I’m going to build a resilient infrastructure, creating good paying jobs. Building roads and bridges and ports. One million new jobs and affordable housing units. Should be one million new affordable housing units. High-speed broadband for every household. A 100 billion dollars to rebuild our crumbling schools. One of the reasons we can’t send our kids back to schools. A lot of them aren’t even safe now. 
We’re going to retrofit as we started our administration when the president allowed me to run the recovery act. We’re going to retrofit four million buildings and weatherize two billion homes. That alone will save 100s of thousands of millions of barrels of oil. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. I’m going to end Trump’s incentives. He talks about his trade deals. As Gary and Debbie know in his trade deals he incentivized people to send jobs abroad. 
Abroad. More taking their jobs overseas. One thing more the United States Government owns and maintains enormous fleet of vehicles. I promise you, the president controls that. I’m going to convert those government fleets into clean vehicles made of and sourced right here in the United States of America. I’m going to expand the capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in clean vehicle production. 
We’re going to make it easier to America’s companies to switch from fuel inefficient vehicles. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations all across the country. Offer consumer rebates to swap old or fuel inefficient vehicles for new clean American made models. Together, this will mean according to the estimates, more than a million good new jobs in the American auto release, because we will own the electric vehicle market in the world. 
Folks I guarantee you, we can do this, but we have to come together. I remember you and I talking gov when I was running for the nomination in my same way to unite the country. You’re the only one whp thought I was right. That used to be the old days. Yeah, Joe, you got a lot done. You used to walk across to get a lot done, but everything’s changed. Well folks, if we can’t unite the country, we’re in trouble. 
America and our system runs on consensus. Compromise is not a dirty word. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. I do not see American terms of red and blue. Bringing the country together, that’s the job of a president. It’s a duty to care. To care for everybody. We can be so much better than what we see. 
We can be what you are at our best, when we’re the United States of America. Folks, you have to vote and people are turning out here in this state and overwhelming numbers around the country. If you have any doubt, go visit iwillvote.com/and-i. Early voting is happening now. Every city and township clerk’s office in the state. You can register to vote in one quick stop. You have your ballot already, mail it or drop it in a Dropbox today. 
Don’t wait, vote, and don’t just vote for me and Senator Harris and Gary as well. Vote all the way down the line. We’re going to need Gary back in the United States Senate, looking out for Michigan families because we’re going to win back the United States Senate. When we do, we’re going to change things. Folks, this time I really mean this to restore the soul of America. To rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class. 
This time is I’d bring everybody along. Debbie, may remember my colleagues in the caucus used to wonder kid me because I quote President Kennedy. When he was about going to the moon and famous speech, everybody remembers the different parts of it. The line I remember more than anything else. He answered the question that wasn’t, it was implicitly being asked, “Why are you doing this?” He said, “Because we’d refused to postpone. I refuse to postpone the work America must do now to bring this country back.” 
There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to American future. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. No other country can do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. Well, we have to let them know who we are. What we stand for, we choose hope over fear, unity over division, science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. Folks thank you and may God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."

Hello, hello, hello, hello, Florida. Miramar. It’s great to be back with you. Thank you so much and thank you, Mr. Mayor for the passport into your city and I want to say thank you to all the speakers you heard earlier. The Mayor, Dale, thank you. County Commissioner, Barbara and Senator Oscar. Look, Senator, you’re looking like you’re still in shape. And I also want to thank Damian for sharing your story and for exercising your power as a young voter, a first time voter. 
Look, you’re an inspiration, man. I really mean that. You’re making your family proud. You’re a role model for an awful lot of young people all across Florida and across the country. Folks, as my old football coach used to say, “It’s go time.” It is go time. It is. No matter whether it’s your first vote or many, but beyond that, this is the most important election in our lifetimes and you can make all the difference here in Florida. You can determine the outcome of this election. 
We win Florida and it’s all over. Look, choice is clear and the stakes have never been higher. The stakes in this election remind me of something that my dad used to say. He said, “Joey, job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in your community. It’s about you being able to look to your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, everything’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.” 
How many people can look their kids in the eye and say that today, “It’s going to be okay,” and mean it? That’s the lesson I’ve never forgotten. That’s why I grew up surrounded by hardworking folks in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware but folks- 
Folks, these times are hard. These times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. The economic outlook for the next year remains uncertain, and across Florida and the country, folks are worried about being able to pay their rent or their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase the prescription or put food on the table, worried about school and their kids. They see the people at the top doing better and better during this crisis, and wondering, “Who’s looking out for me?” 
Folks, that’s Donald Trump’s presidency: 115,000 dead from COVID-19. And experts say, unless we change rapidly, and he has shown no indication he’s willing to change or do the proper thing, we could lose another 200,000 lives the next few months, all because this president is only worried about the stock market, didn’t want to scare anybody. He refused to follow science. It’s established, it’s estimated that if, in fact, we all wore masks between now and January, we could save 100,000 lives over the next few months. 
Folks, what bothers me the most about this guy, in his own words, the president knew back in January, when he was briefed in detail, after lying about it, saying he never read the intelligence community’s warnings about how dangerous this was, what did he do? He learned in January, the end of January, and in fact, that in fact this was a virulent virus, that it was passed on easily, that it was airborne. But he didn’t tell anybody. He went on and tape an interview with Bob Woodward, a journalist, trying to ingratiate himself to him, telling him he knew how dangerous the disease was back in January. But he did nothing, not a single thing. Didn’t say a word to anybody. Ask yourself, why didn’t he tell the country? He said nothing. When he told Woodward, when Woodward asked him why he didn’t say anything, he said, “I didn’t want to panic the American people.” The American people do not panic; Donald Trump panicked! We don’t scare! 
Americans have faced every problem that has ever confronted us, and his reckless personal conduct since the diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump remains president, the more reckless he becomes. Three more weeks before we end this madness. 
Folks, the most respected doctor in the country on this issue is Dr. Fauci. He referred to the president’s announcement of the Supreme Court with a political event in the Rose Garden, or in the backyard of the White House, he called it a superspreading event. Look at all the people who became contagious and got ill. And how is he responding now? He, Trump, is running a national ad on television, you may have seen it, taking a quote of Dr. Fauci out of context. He said Dr. Fauci said way back in March, referring to the public health officials, he said, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” referring to the public health officials across America. Yet, the Trump campaign deliberately lied, making it as sound as if Fauci was talking about Trump. Fauci went public after the ad came out, saying, “I did not give permission for that quote, and it wasn’t referring to the president.” 
Folks, here’s the real point about the lack of ethics: even after Fauci said he didn’t say that about Trump, the Trump campaign said they’ll continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. Folks, I don’t recall any administration, any presidential candidate in either major party doing anything like that. 
That behavior’s no surprise, though. After all, this is the same man who looks at Americans who put their lives on the line for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. Folks, I carry with me a card, my schedule card, that lays out on the back my schedule. The last back page, in a black box I carried every day for the past 13 years, it says, “Daily troop updates. U.S. troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan: 6,924.” Not around 6,900, 924, because every one of these fallen angels left behind an entire community. They deserve our respect. 
“Troops wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq: 53,194,” not 53,000 about. Folks, my son was one of those who volunteered to go to Iraq for a year, came home and he passed away. He was not a loser. He was an American hero. He won the Bronze Star, the [inaudible 00:14:05] Service Medal. And all his comrades left behind, they were patriots. Who the heck does this guy think he is? 
And now, as a consequence of this overwhelming line and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are there around dinner tables tonight because of his negligence? How many husbands or wives at night lean over to touch and say good night to their wife or husband and they’re not there? How many people have holes in their heart and lost part of their soul? Debbie Ross and I talk about this. How can we have a guy like this? 
Ladies and gentlemen, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity to build this country back better. We’re the only nation in the world, with every crisis we’ve run into, we’ve ended up better off coming out of it than we were before we went in. That’s because America, there’s no quit in America. None! None! 
It’s about time we start rewarding work, not wealth. To get everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead. For example, for communities of color in South Florida and all across this country, the question is how do we break the cycle where in good times you lag behind, and in bad times you get hit first and the hardest, and when recovery comes, you’re the last ones to bounce back? The answer is simple: justice. 
… back. The answer is simple, justice, criminal justice, police reform. I know the nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and our businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning. We have no need for armed militias roaming American streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist, white supremacist groups marching on our communities. 
Folks, enough, I say we should trust American law enforcement authorities to do their job, as I do. Let them do their job without extremists and vigilantes. And if you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country, you haven’t opened your eyes in America. There have been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, I spent time with George Floyd’s family, his six year old daughter, Gianna, when I met with her, I knelt down to say hi to her and she looked at me and said, “Daddy changed the world. Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother, who I got to know when she said, “The violence didn’t reflect her son and the nation needed healing,” and she prayed for the police. 
Or Doc Rivers, a basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung.” Went on to say, “It’s amazing why we keep loving this country, when this country does not love us back.” Think about that. Think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That’s a deep love for this country. That for far too long, has gone never fully recognized. 
We need American leadership to seek out, to deescalate tensions, to open the lines of communication, to bring us together. Look, ladies and gentlemen, we have time… President to heal, heal to hope, as President I’ll do precisely what I will do. 
But it’s also about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth and passing it down. That’s how we deliver equality and equity. For example, more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession, whether in a city or out in the suburbs. We have a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly, tracing, testing, masking, not politicizing race for vaccines. Look, we have to get vaccines, not politicize it. And we have to plan for a safe and equitable distribution. We have to provide what as of today is not happening, funding for protective equipment, PPE, and other resources for hospital and frontline workers, so the schools can reopen safely. We got to ease the caregiving crisis that so many families experience, a squeeze of raising your kids and caring for an aged loved one. You got to protect your health care. 
In the middle of this pandemic, why do the Republicans have time to hold a hearing to pack the court instead of providing significant economic relief and need for localities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, to wipe it off the books. Because their nominee has said in the past, that the law should be struck down. That will take away health care for 20 million Americans. It will take protections away from pre-existing conditions for over a hundred million people. And by the way, kids won’t be able to stay in their parent’s health insurance until they’re 26. 
Complications of COVID-19 like lung scarring, heart damage, will become the next pre-existing condition. We’ll toss out, toss out the coverage for so many children. It will take us backwards to when insurance companies could charge a woman, many of you won’t remember this, but charge a woman more for her healthcare than a man, just because she’s a woman for the same procedure. Folks, we can do so much better than this. Together, we’ll build on the Affordable Care Act. By adding a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit option, to give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies to premiums and lower cost to get more coverage, lower deductibles, lower out-of-pocket expenses. And by the way, anybody, anybody who qualifies for Medicare, but lives in a state like your governor that doesn’t allow for 800,000 people to have it, will automatically be enrolled. It’s wrong. 
But we can only do this, if we come as a country. Last week, I went to Gettysburg, the battlefield in Pennsylvania. Abraham Lincoln, to make a point, we’re in trouble. Abraham Lincoln said there, that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing, hope is elusive. Instead of healing, we’re being ripped apart. And I refuse to let that happen. When I announced, when I was running, I said I was running, one of the reasons was to unite America and I was made fun of. They said, “You can’t do that anymore. You used to be able to do it, Joe. You can’t do it now.” But the only way democracy can function is with consensus. Otherwise, it becomes semi-dictatorial like this guys trying to be. 
Look, we need to revive the spirit of bipartisan in the country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that I’m told that that was fine, Joe. You used to be able to do that, but you can’t do it anymore. Well, I’m here to tell you, we can, we must, and we’re going to get it done. 
Look, I’m running as a proud Democrat. But I will govern as an American President. I’ll work for Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work for those who vote against me, as hard as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a President, to heal. It’s a duty to care, to care for every… 
It’s a duty to care, to care for everyone. Look, folks, and you too have a sacred duty. As my friend, John Lewis, who recently passed away would say, “It’s a sacred obligation to vote. And it matters.” Florida matters. You elected me and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. And I’m asking for your trust and support again in 2020 for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. 
Because, folks, I promise you, I promise you, we will always have your back. I promise you. I give you my word. So, please vote, and help us get out the vote. It’s been mentioned before to go to iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot and do it as soon as you can. If you haven’t already mailed yours and you have one, mail it, or drop it in a box today, drop box today. You can also vote in person starting October 19th here in Broward County where this election will be determined. 
Folks, the country needs you. Tell everyone you know, everyone you meet, to vote no matter what. Don’t let anyone discourage you or tell you your voice won’t count. It does. It will. You are the American people, and you will decide our future, not Trump. So, vote. Folks. 
Thank you. As my friend, the Congresswoman, Debbie knows, I hadn’t planned on running this time. My son had passed away, and I was working as a professor, and I thought, “Enough.” But then, when I saw those people coming out of the fields in Charlottesville, my word, carrying torches, close your eyes. Remember what you saw. Their veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile, carrying Nazi insignias that were carried and chanted in Germany, in the 30s. Accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists, David Duke, the grand [preagle 00:27:09] saying, “This is why we elected him.” 
And then a young woman protesting was killed. They went to the president of United States and they said, “Mr. President, what do you think?” Here’s what he said. Something no president in American history has ever said, ” There were very fine people on both sides.” God almighty. 
That’s when I realized, and I said at the time, we’re literally in a battle for the soul of this country, for our decency, our honor, our compassion, who we are. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men and women are great. Folks, we’ve never fully lived up to that. We’ve never walked away from it. Every generation has opened the aperture wider. This is the first president ever that’s flat walked away from it. 
It’s time to restore America’s soul. It’s time to rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class. It’s time to bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your gender, your ethnicity, your sexual orientation, or your disability. It’s time to unite America. And we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear. By choosing science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. 
There’s nothing beyond the capacity of this nation when we stand together. So it’s time to stand up, take back this democracy. When I was a kid and John Kennedy said, “We’re going to the moon.” Everybody remembers. We all had to learned what he said about that, the speech. There’s one line and it always used on the Senate floor when I was a Senator. My colleges would kid me. 
And he answered the unasked question, “Why are we doing this?” He said, “Because I refuse to postpone.” I refuse to postpone one more day this president’s irresponsible action. So let’s get up. Let’s take back this country. Show the world who we are. May God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you."

Good to see you all. Please, please, take a seat if you have one. Thank you so very, very much for… It’s good to be back in Florida. I want to thank my good friend Debbie Wasserman Schultz, congresswoman. She’s been a tireless fighter. Where’s Debbie? There she is. Thank you, Debbie. You’ve been a friend a long time, and thank you for all the encouragement. 
Toby, I also want to thank you. Toby moved from a high rent district in Brooklyn. That’s the highest rent district in America right now these days. [inaudible 00:09:48], good to see you. I want to thank you for that kind introduction. It’s wonderful to be here with all of you to hear the stories, talk about how we’re going to get through these tough times, the difficult times. Today’s- 
… tough times and difficult times. Today’s story is a familiar one here in South Florida. We’re all living in some version of it right now with some of the most important parts of our lives being put on hold and the same story being lived by people like Carl Schechner, who many of you know well. Carl’s here today, I’m told. Hey Carl. How are you, man? Good to see you. The light was shining right in my eyes looking at you, man. I apologize. Carl is 39 years old. No, 93 years old, but he acts like he’s 39 years old. And the pillar of this community. So much so that a few years back, you all decided to rename this community center in his honor. I’ve heard wonderful things about you, Carl, and looking forward to saying hello to you privately. 
I had the pleasure of meeting Carl back in 2012. He may not remember it, but his story is what this community and this country is all about. Carl is a son of an immigrant. Carl served our nation honorably in the second World War and met his sweetheart, Anita, when they were … They’ve been married now for 67 years. Together, they built a family, four children, seven grandchildren. And more than 30 years, they made home here, staying engaged in all the local issues and holding local office, catching Sunday matinees and performances at the arts center and socializing with neighbors, enjoying nights in the town. And a couple of times, two, three times a week, going out. 
But their story, like so many others, is a quintessential American story these days, but it has been interrupted this year. Carl and Anita haven’t been out, I’m told, to a restaurant in seven months and there are no more Sunday matinees. Other than getting groceries, they spend most of their time in their apartment like so many people do. It’s harder than ever to spend time with the people you love, other than on Zoom or on a computer connection. We’ve all felt that sense of interruption in our lives. And we all know that this isn’t normal, that things didn’t have to be this bad. They didn’t have to be this bad. We look around at our neighbors and we know people are hurting. A lot of folks are worried about making their next rent payment, their next mortgage payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or put food on the table. And we see an awful lot of people at the very top doing better than they’ve ever done and left to wonder an awful lot of us is, “Who’s looking out for me? Who’s looking out for me?” 
That’s been the entire story of my view of Donald Trump’s presidency. The fact that he’s never been focused on what matters. He’s never been focused on you. His handling of this pandemic has been erratic, just like his presidency has been. And it has prevented Florida’s seniors and people all across the country from getting the relief that they need. Donald Trump hasn’t just been willing to not do the work. I think it’s beyond that. I’m not sure he cares about delivering any real help. I think it’s both. People say he’s not willing to do the work. Well, I don’t think he cares much about it. While you’re losing precious time with your loved ones, he’s been stuck in a sand trap in one of his golf courses. And when he does decide to lift a finger, it doesn’t help you. It’s to propose new tax cuts for billionaires, and that’s not hyperbole. That’s not hyperbole. 100 wealthiest billionaires in America are expected to get another $30 billion tax cut he’s proposing. 
We know what happened the last time a tax cut was passed in 2017 when he came into office. Pharmaceutical companies got billions of dollars in tax breaks, and then they turned around and raised prices for medicines that you rely on to stay healthy. And they’re still doing it even during the pandemic. And quite frankly, it’s unconscionable. But Trump doesn’t really care about lowering the healthcare costs because he’s beholden to the health insurance companies and the drug companies. After all, he’s asking the United States Supreme Court as I speak, he’s asking them right now to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, which would eliminate seniors’ ability … Most of you are on Medicare, but it would eliminate your ability in that act we passed, I was able to help put in place, was that you’d have preventative services and annual checkups and mammograms for free under Medicare. If it gets struck down, that gets wiped out as well. The rise in prescription drug prices for millions of seniors put Medicare trust fund at risk. 
And by the way, we used to talk about the Medicare trust fund. I say the Republicans want to eliminate it. But remember, Debbie will remember when, he’s not a bad guy in terms of his personality, but when the former Speaker of the House became Speaker, what’d they do? They proposed a half a billion dollar cut in Medicare from the start, right off the bat. These guys mean what they say. This President, as Debbie pointed out, has pledged to terminate the tax that’s dedicated to financing social security. Terminate it. A social security actuary, not Joe Biden or a liberal think tank or a newspaper. The actuary, the social security says, that would bankrupt social security in just a few years, putting those monthly checks for tens of millions of seniors that they rely on, and many of them, the only thing they rely on, at risk. 
All this president knows how to do is play games with people’s lives and families’ futures. Last week, he announced he was “walking away from the negotiations” that he never fully engaged in. He’s not walking away. He never fully engaged in them. To provide any additional relief for American families. Debbie, working like the devil in the house, they passed the HEROES Act. They passed two other pieces of legislation earlier to provide for the ability to keep people from going out of business, people being kicked out of their homes, et cetera. He turned his back on small businesses that are struggling to keep their doors open. He turned his back on firefighters and police officers and first responders who depend on local budgets, but local budgets are being broken and they have to be balanced. 
I’ll just make note here. When we inherited the largest recession, the greatest recession since the depression, what happened? President put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. First thing I was able to do, and I was able to manage it myself, was I put $147 billion to just help state and local authorities be able to balance their budgets, not have to fire police officers, not have to fire firefighters, not to fire first responders, not have to close down health clinics. Local governments are strained to the breaking point. He turned his back on educators and school children, standing in the way of support to get them PPE and cleaning supplies and ventilation needed to reopen schools safely, which we could do if we funded it. He turned his back on every single worker whose job hasn’t come back. 
And now he says he wants a deal. One day he’s tweeting that the relief package is too big. The next day saying it’s too small. It’s all game. He thinks he’s still on his game show. No really. He acts that way. For real. This is a political game he’s playing. His latest gimmick, he wants to mail seniors a $200 prescription drug cash card with his name on it. So you’re going to get it before election with his name on it. But what are you going to do? He’s going to raid Medicare trust fund to pay for that $200, which seniors have already spent by paying money into. He thinks that he can take the money out of your pocket with one hand and put it back with his name stamped on it in the other hand and call it a gift. It’s dishonest. It’s reckless. And it doesn’t actually help anybody. In fact, all it will do is undermine the Medicare trust fund and increase overall out-of-pocket costs for seniors. 
Let’s be clear about this. Donald Trump has tried for almost four years, he says he wants to lower the drug price. Okay? But he hadn’t done a single thing to do it. In fact, the House of Representatives passed a bill that Debbie supported that would bring down prescription drug costs across the board, giving Medicare the power in Washington, Medicare department, the power to negotiate with the drug companies and say, “If an aspirin is going to cost, if we’re being charged …” I’m making this up. “If an aspirin is going to cost two cents an aspirin,” they said, “We’re only going to pay you a penny an aspirin.” They’re either going to do it or not. They’re going to have to do it. We’ve been fighting to get, Debbie and I and others, have been fighting to be able to do this for years. It would lower drug prices. What did President Trump do? He said, “If it passes, he’ll veto it.” Threatened to veto it. Folks, Donald Trump’s chaotic and divisive leadership has cost us far too much. 215,000 deaths from COVID-19 and rising. Experts say we’ll lose nearly another 200,000 lives in the next few months unless we fundamentally change courses. You know, I prayed for his recovery when he got COVID and I’d hoped at least he’d come out of it somewhat chastened. But what has he done? He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. 
He’s just doubled down on the misinformation he did before and making it worse. So many lives have been lost unnecessary because this President cares more about the stock market than he does about the well-being of seniors. 
One day before we crossed the threshold of 200,000 deaths, you may recall this, the President was at the campaign rally and insistent that the virus was, and I quote, “Affects virtually nobody, just elderly people with heart and other problems.” Nobody. Think about that. Who was he talking about when he said it infects virtually nobody? He was talking about America’s seniors. He was talking about you. He was talking about my family. You’ve worked hard your whole life contributing to society, building a family, building the country, serving America. You deserve security. You deserve respect and peace of mind, but you’re not getting it. 
And by the way, if this wasn’t so bizarre, if I tried to make a movie talking about something like this in America, you’d think I was making it up. Because Donald Trump, it’s simple, not a joke, you’re expendable. You’re forgettable. You’re virtually nobody. That’s how he sees seniors. That’s how he sees you. 
It’s no surprise this is the same man that looks at Americans who put their lives on the line like you did, sir, and many others maybe in this room, for our nation and calls them losers and suckers. I carried this card with me every day for the last 15 years. It’s my schedule. In the back of this schedule, I have a black box. It says, “Daily troop update.” The number of troops who died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,924. Not roughly 6,900, 924 because every one of these fallen angels that left a family behind deserves to be remembered. Everyone. US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,000, as of today, 194. Everyone with only one sacred obligation, America, to care for those we send a war and equip them when they come home and take care of them and their families. And what did he say? Losers. 
My son volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Before that, he had been in Kosovo for eight months. Best of my knowledge, the only foreigner who has a war monument and a major highway in that country named after him for his contribution to helping them set up their criminal justice system, then he volunteered to go to Iraq as attorney general for a year. My son was not a loser. And all of those left behind, he’s passed away, but all those left behind, they were heroes. They were patriots. I imagine that’s one of the reasons why six four-star generals and a whole lot of others have endorsed me who used to work for him because they know where his heart isn’t. 
That’s how he sees us. That’s the attitude he’s brought toward this whole crisis. This is the same man, you may remember, when he was told we were averaging 1000 lives lost per day, remember what he said? He said, “It is what it is.” Such concern and empathy. It is what it is. Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. That’s why it is what it is. This President, as Debbie referenced, back in January when he was being briefed by the intelligence community, he said, “I never read the briefing.” Didn’t know what was in. Didn’t have time. Well, [inaudible 00:24:15] ego moved him to try to convince a famous journalist to write something good about him. What happened? Bob Woodward interviewed him. He acknowledged that he knew it was a dangerous and highly communicable disease, but he did nothing. He didn’t do a thing. He didn’t tell you. He didn’t tell any American. Why? He told Woodward on tape, he told Bob he didn’t want to panic the American public. 
Americans don’t panic. Trump panics. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis is unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is the President, the more reckless he seems to get. Thank God we only have three weeks left to go. 
Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc in the country on these issues, referred to the President’s announcement on the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden, using the White House as a backdrop for political events. He said it was a super spreader event. And how is Trump responding? He’s running a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Fauci had said way back in March, referring to public health officials across the nation, he said, quote, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” end of quote, meaning public health officials. 
But the Trump campaign, which is not unusual because I’ve had a piece of it, the trump campaign has deliberately lied. They have put Dr. Fauci in their ad asserting that Fauci was talking about Trump when he said they couldn’t have done anymore. And Fauci’s a man of integrity. After that ad came out, he said, “I did not give permission to use that quote and I wasn’t referring to the President.” Even after Fauci said that he didn’t say that about the President, the Trump ad campaign said they were going to continue to use the ad knowing it was a lie. Can any of you ever remember anything like that in a presidential campaign with a mainstream candidate? 
And as a consequence to months of lying and misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are around the dining room table tonight because of his negligence? How many people’s hearts are broken? How many people have trouble going to sleep at night because you can’t just reach over and touch? They can’t hear their son or daughter’s voice on the phone, while he throws super spreader parties at the White House where Republicans hug each other without concern to the consequences. 
How many of you have been unable to hug your grandkids in the last seven months? I got six of them. Two of them I just see [inaudible 00:27:53] children, a boy and a girl live not far from me and they can walk through the woods. The only way I can see them, I stand in the back porch and they stand down and I bribe them with Haagen-Dazs bars. But every single day I contact them. But I can’t hug them. I can’t embrace it. And I’m luckier than most because they’re nearby, those two of those six. 
My grandkids, your grandkids, we hope will grow up to treat one another with kindness, respect and empathy, qualities the President has never, ever shown. It’s become painfully clear as his careless arrogant, reckless COVID response has caused one of the worst tragedies in American history. The only senior that Donald Trump cares about, the only senior is the senior Donald Trump [inaudible 00:28:52] seem to do anything for. 
And by the way, minority communities are getting particularly hit by this. You realize as of about a month ago, on a percentage basis, 1 in 1000 African Americans in all of American have died. And the estimate is, by the end of this year, 1 in 500 African Americans in America will die. 1 in 500. If he doesn’t do something quickly and we hit 400,000, that is more people, the same number of people that died in the war you fought of all four years. 400,000 dead in War War II, in less than a year if he doesn’t move. The only one Donald Trump would do anything for is Donald Trump. 
Look, folks, you all know we’re so much better than this. We- 
We’re so much better than this. We can contain this virus. We can fully reopen our economy. We can bring Congress together to pass real relief, and then implement a comprehensive agenda to build back better. My economic proposal … And by the way, it’s not a liberal think tank or a Democratic think tank that says this. An independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm, projects that my economic plan will create 18.6 million good paying jobs between now and the end of the first term. Seven million more jobs than the President’s plan. And create a trillion more dollars in economic growth than the President’s plan. It’s solid. It’s real. 
Here’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on a single solitary American making less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. It’s a guarantee. But I’m going to ask big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay their fair share to straighten out the tax structure. That money will allow us to invest in working people. I carry it with me … I don’t know if I have it with me now, I don’t … a card that lists all of what is in the tax code. We went ahead, the President’s tax plan, Barack and I were suggesting we reduce corporate tax from 35% to 28. That was the consensus. He reduced it to 21%. You know how much that costs? $1.3 trillion. We just take it back up to 28, and we’ll generate $1.3 trillion more. 
91 of the Fortune 500 companies don’t pay a penny in tax. Not a single solitary cent. If we made sure there was a minimum tax at 15%, that would add another $400 billion. We’re going to take this money and we’re going to invest in a working people, in a growing middle class and make sure everyone is included in the deal. I want tax reform in the tax code because we’re spending your tax dollars on the wrong things. As I said, Donald Trump cut the tax from 35 to 21 costing the treasury a fortune. As I said, if we raised it back to 28%, $1.3 trillion would be coming to the treasury over the next decade, instead of giving big corporations hundreds of billions to pay for buying back their own stock, moving jobs overseas. 
We should invest it in cures for cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. That’s why I proposed giving the National Institute of Health $50 billion over the next four years to go after cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. If we do not, and no drug company has the capacity to do it, if we do not find an answer to Alzheimer’s, then the next 19 years, every single solitary bed that exists in the United States of America now will be occupied by an Alzheimer’s patient. 
Look, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, if everything’s equally important to you, nothing’s important to you. You have to have priorities.” What are our priorities? Our priorities is to make sure that everybody in America has an equal shot. This is about you. It’s about what’s fair. It’s about what our priorities should be, and we can deal with the scourge of cancer and these other diseases when Donald Trump has no interest. In fact, he wants to do the opposite. He proposes more tax cuts for the super wealthy. Like Donald Trump, we’re going to ease the burden on major costs in your life, unlike him. Including the financial burden of caregiving so many families are now carrying. 
Right now, as you probably know, and you have friends, 800,000 Americans are eligible for home community care through Medicaid, signed up for it, have been waiting an average of five years. They’re waiting for a phone call back. For some, five years. My plan makes a bold investment so the states can clear the waiting list and also take the pharmaceutical companies. Will allow Medicaid to, again, use its enormous bargaining power to negotiate prices and bring the costs down for everyone, not just seniors. Give all Americans access to those lower prices. 
And what he also hates my doing and so do the drug companies, we’re going to establish a board like it is in other countries of outside experts to set limits on the prices of new specialty drugs that are life-saving drugs that costs an arm and leg, figuratively and literally, that have no competition. This board is going to set up and say, “This is how much you can charge based on what you’ve invested. You make a healthy profit, but you will not be able to raise the price of the drug without proof that you’ve taken other action that you have required you to improve the drug.” So it can only be raised with the cost of medical inflation. 
Independent analysis found that my plan will slash the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. How many of you know somebody who’s had to sell things just to get the drugs that have gone up exponentially? We’re going to protect Social Security and increase benefits for millions of seniors. I’ll fight to protect your pensions, including fixing older employer pensions, so many Floridians earned and deserve. Folks, I guess we’ll see them with this. I’m confident. I know as bad as things are we say, “Oh my God, how can it get better?” I am absolutely confident we can do this and more. We just have to come together. I’m running as a proud Democrat. I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who voted against me as those who voted for me. 
That’s the job of a president. A duty to care. To care for everyone. And after all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years that we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot let ourselves remain divided, but we have to vote. Go to, Iwillvote.com/fl. You can still request your vote by mail ballot. The deadline’s October 24. Request your ballot. If you have it already mail it or drop it in one of the drop boxes today. Look, I’m tired of us all walking around with our heads down, as if there’s nothing we can do. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity, nothing we’ve ever decided to do we’ve not accomplished, when we done it together. Remember when we were kids, you had to learn about famous speech John Kennedy made about going to the moon. Everybody remembers the different pieces of it. 
The part I remember, my college used to kid me in the Senate when I was there. When answering the unasked question, “Why was he doing it?” He said, “Because we refuse to postpone.” We refuse to postpone one more day, which is within our capacity as Americans to do. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. There’s no limit to our future. We’ve got to stand up, lift our heads up. The only thing that can tear America part is America itself. And he’s well on the way trying to do that. Everybody knows who Donald Trump is. That’s within who we are. Who we are. We choose hope over fear. Unity, over division. Science over fiction. And yes, truth over lies. We can do this folks. I promise you. But you got to vote. May god bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for listening. You’re a very patient audience. Thank you, thank you. Appreciate it."
34,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-cincinnati-museum-center-transcript-october-12,Joe Biden Campaign Speech Cincinnati Museum Center Transcript October 12,"It’s good to be back. Thank you. Thank you. It’s good to be back, Mr. Mayor, in this former terminal museum. I tell you what, this is a magnificent facade, isn’t it? I understand that a few marriage proposals were made by standing in that corner and whispering to someone in the other corner. 
Mr. Mayor, thank you for the passport into the city. Thank you for your friendship. I was looking around for it. I couldn’t see you in the light. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. And thank you for… The Mayor is very good friends with a fellow who, one of the brightest, most decent men I know, who occupies my seat in the United States Senate, Senator Chris Coons. They were Truman scholars together. And you guys seem like you’re cut from the same cloth. Thank you very, very much for your support. I appreciate it, Mr. Mayor 
And Kate, you’re something else. Now, Kate, you know, there’s an old joke. A long time ago, particular senator said to me, this is back when I was much younger, I was in my second term, running for my second term. He said, “Joe, I’ll come to Delaware for you and campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most.” My offer still holds. I hope my endorsement didn’t hurt you. But all kidding aside, Kate, we need you in the US Congress. And I really mean it. And the reason I say that is you’re a healthcare advocate, a cancer survivor, a mom, and we need leaders like you representing the people in the First District. People who understand what’s going on every day, the discussions that take place around the kitchen table in the morning. Our families are still struggling trying to figure out what to do. And Joyce, thank you for that introduction. Before I begin, let me say that I’m saddened to hear that one of my baseball heroes, Joe Morgan, second baseman, Red’s legend, Hall of Famer and a good man passed away. And my condolences to the Morgan family and his teammates and to his fans here in Cincinnati and all across the country. He played one year on the Philadelphia Phillies. 
Now, I’m going to get myself in real trouble, but I have a bad habit of telling you the truth. I happened to grow up in a household in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where, if you wanted to have dinner, you had to be Yankees fan because that was the farm called, the Triple A ball club was a Yankee ball club. And my grandpop was an All-American football player, but he was a great Yankees fan. But it wasn’t hard back in those days. There was Whitey Ford and a few others, but in Delaware, if you are not a Phillies fan, and let me put this way, if I were not a Phillies fan, I’d be sleeping alone. My wife’s a Philly girl. You think I’m kidding. I’m not. 
But Joe actually played for a year in the Phillies if my memory serves me correctly, but he had fans all over the country. It’s amazing to be both the heart when he was a second baseman, and the voice as one of the great baseball announcers in history, of the same club. I mean, that’s a pretty incredible accomplishment. And so, my best to his family and to his fans, and he has fans all across the country. 
Folks, as my football coach says, “Go time, Joe.” It’s go time. This is the most important election of our lifetimes, not because I’m running, because what’s at stake. The next president is going to determine not just the next four years, but what the next decade or more is going to look like because there’s such a stark fundamental difference. And you here in Cincinnati can make all the difference and all the difference in Ohio. 
I learned a long time ago coming out to Ohio that you win Ohio from Cincinnati north. Head north. Well, you are the starting gate, and I love being back here. And again, what a beautiful museum and terminal this is. I spent a lot of time, as I was telling the Mayor, in train stations. 
When I first got elected to the United States Senate, I was 29. I was in Washington and interviewing my first staff using Senator Kennedy’s whip office. And I got a phone call from a first responder saying my wife and daughter had just been killed, and my two boys were really badly injured, and not sure they were going to make it. My fire department, and God, I love my fire service, took about three hours and the jaws of life to get my kids out of the car because they were broadsided by a tractor trailer. And I didn’t want any part of going to the United States Senate. My sister managed my campaign, and my younger sister and my much younger brother raised all the money we raised, $187,000. We went to our governor to determine who would they pick in my spot because I didn’t plan on going. A lot of really fine men who were in the Senate at the time, and Republicans and Democrats came to me and said, “Just come and stay for six months and help us organize.” 
And so I started commuting every day back and forth, and that’s how I got involved as sort of Mr. Amtrak. Because when they publish that, they keep fastidious records on how many miles you travel on government aircraft when your vice president. And I had traveled a little over, I think it was a 1,400,000 miles. It was on the front page of the paper, but I used to like to take the train home on Fridays still as Vice President because it costs a lot of money to take that small plane back. But in addition to that, the Secret Service felt much more secure if I wasn’t on a train, but they humored me and let me go home on Fridays sometimes. My mom was living at my home as she was passing. 
And I remember getting on the train and a guy named Angelo Negrea, I got to know their families, all the conductors and all the people all those years. And he came up to me and he grabbed me and he said, “Joey.” He grabbed my cheek. I was thought the Secret Service was going to shoot him. I said, “No.” I said, “He’s okay.” It’s a true story. And he said, “I just read, Joey, 1,400,000 miles on Air Force Two, big deal. The boys, we were checking. We had our retirement dinner. Went up to New Jersey for the dinner. You know how many miles you traveled on Amtrak?” I said, “No, Ang, I don’t.” He said, “Joey,” he said, “we figure 117 days a year, 36 years, and then X number of days as Vice President, you’ve traveled 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak.” I think I hold the record, other than a conductor. 
And so they gave me a key to the engine because I can… I’m the only one I know of. I’m not supposed to say that, but I got it hidden. My point is that, as a sidelight, one of the ways we’re going to revive this economy is we’re going to end up moving high speed rail and commuter rail across this country in a way that we haven’t done before. 
But the reason I went home was the same reason why all you do, or try to, and that is to be there in the evening when my kids went to bed. In the morning, my son, Beau, my son, Hunter, and my daughter, Ashley, get them back to school in the morning on the way to the station, and then when they got older, it wasn’t the case, but gets to kiss them goodnight. And as they kid, “I know, Dad, we got to say three Hail Marys and God bless our troops.” So for 36 years we did this, 250 miles roundtrip. 
And folks, you know, it’s really one way that I’ve said this before and I apologize for the press that travels with me for repeating it, but as I’d ride home- 
… that travels with me, from repeating it, but as I ride home at night, and usually I could get the seven o’clock, the last fast train. Now they call it the [cell oh 00:00:11] . It was then called the Metro, was at seven o’clock and I’d ride. You get outside the Beltway exit and you ride by all these neighbors. I look into windows and wonder, literally sitting there, looking out the window. What are those parents talking about at that dining room table tonight? What are they doing before, they put their kids to bed, right after they put the kids to bed and come back and sit down. My guess is they’re talking about the same things that we talked about all across the country, and we’re talking about today. They’re asking questions, and one of theirs, as profound as they’re ordinary. “Are we going to be okay? Are going to make it?” 
“What are we going to do? Who’s going to tell her we don’t have the money to go back to that community college. Who’s going to, you got to drive another 1000 miles on those bald tires. We just don’t have the money right now to get four new tires.” This election is about answering those kinds of questions. Who’s on their side? My dad used to have an expression for real. My dad, he didn’t have work when coal died and Scranton. My dad was a salesperson. He wasn’t a coal miner. My great-grandfather was a mining engineer, but my dad used to say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay’, and mean it.” 
That’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. It’s what I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families and Scranton, Pennsylvania. When my dad had to move to Delaware, took us home to my grandpa for a year, but we finally got down. We got together again. That’s the discussions we had in Claymont and Scranton, like here in Cincinnati, but times are hard. Unemployment is up, due to the pandemic and economic outlook remains very uncertain and very mishandled. Across Ohio, and in this country folks are worried about making their next rent payment or mortgage payment, whether or not they’re going to be out in the street, whether or not they can purchase that prescription drug they need, or how much food they can put on the table. 
Making hard choices. Worry about whether the school their child is enrolled in, is going to be able to be open or what do they do if I still have a job, but I have a young child? If I go to work and their school’s not open, who takes care of them? How do we do that? They see the people at the top doing better and better, even in the midst of this God-awful recession, while they’re left to wonder. I mean, this sincerely, they’re have to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presence. 215,000 people dead from COVID-19. Experts are telling us, we may lose up to another 200,000 lives, by end of January, all because the president is only worried about one thing, the stock market, because he refused to follow science. 
It’s estimated that if we just wore masks, the mask I just took off to speak. Experts tell us, we could save between now and the end of the year, 100,000 lives. The president knew back in January. I think it was the 28th of January, when the intelligence community kept telling him how serious this pandemic would be. He knew it was extremely dangerous, an extremely communicable disease, airborne, but he didn’t tell anybody. But out of his desire to try to get Bob Woodward, to write something good about him, he did a long interview with Woodward, a famous journalist, and he went on record, on tape. He’s taped as saying, Trump is, that he knew how dangerous this disease was, but he did and said nothing except praise she, for the great service he was performing, how transparent he was. 
Ask yourself, why did he not tell the country? Or what, how much better off would it be, had he told the country. He said nothing. He told Bob Woodward, they didn’t want to panic the American public. Americans don’t panic. Trump panicked. Trump is the one who panicked, his reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis, as well, has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is president, the more reckless he gets. Dr. Fauci, the most respected person in this area, in the country, referred to the president’s announcement event, for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden as a super-spreader event, publicly criticizing him. 
How is the president of responding? He’s running a national ad here in Cincinnati and all across the country, quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Dr. Fauci said, back in March, referring to public health officials, “I can’t imagine anybody could be doing more,” referring to public health officials. But Trump and his campaign were very much used to deception and not telling the truth. Deliberately lie by putting Fauci in his ad, implying that Fauci was talking about Trump, saying he doesn’t know how anybody could do any better. Fauci, after he saw the ad, he went public. You’ve probably seen it on the nightly news. He came after that and he said, “I did not get permission for that quote to be used, and it wasn’t about the president.” Even after he said that, and the point, I listened to your talk, even after he said that, look what happened. 
They continued to lie. They said, “We’re keeping it in the ad.” Same ad that says, I’m going to increase taxes on middle-class folks, with the same amount of credibility. Look, they use the ad knowing it’s a lie. Can you remember any other major, mainstream presidential candidate ever doing something like these things? As a consequence of months of overwhelming lying, misleading, irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs are going to be around the dinner table tonight, because of their negligence? How many? How many brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, moms, dads are gone? 
Folks, we’re so much better than this. Despite the crisis we face, we have an enormous opportunity. Like America’s done, unlike any other country, after every crisis, we’ve always come out of the crisis stronger than we were before we went in. That’s the uniqueness of who we are. We now have an opportunity to build back and build back better, to get everyone a fair return on their work, an equal chance to get ahead, begin to reward work, not just wealth. For example, for communities of color here in Cincinnati and all across the country, the question is, “How do we break the cycle, wherein good times, they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and harder?” 
… where in good times they lag. In bad times, they get hit first and hardest. In a recovery, they’re the last and toughest to bounce back. The answer is justice, justice, criminal justice, police reforms. I know this nation is strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong on it to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses that too often bear the brunt of looting and burning, which is never justified. We have no need though for armed militia roaming the streets. We should have no tolerance for extremist White supremacist groups menacing our communities. 
Even reading what’s happening up in Michigan. The Governor is a good friend. They were in her driveway with assault weapons, standing there, because you can open carry in their state, attempting to intimidate. Remember, in, I was going to call it a debate, but the shouting match he engaged in, when he was asked by a Fox reporter, not a left wing somebody or other, would he condemn White supremacy, he never answered the question. I said, “What about those guys that you in fact talk about all the time,” those boys he talks about? He said, “Well, I would just tell them to stand back and stand by.” Neighborhoods I worked in, in the Black community in Delaware, that’s called a dog whistle. You say we should trust the American law enforcement authorities to their job as I do then let them do their job without extremest groups acting as vigilantes. 
If you say we have no need to face racial injustice in this country you haven’t opened your eyes to what’s been going on in this country and has for a long time. I decided to run for President and I hadn’t planned on it for real, but I decided to run when I saw those folks marching out of the fields in Charlottesville. Close your eyes and you remember what you saw on television? These White supremacist, Nazi sympathizers, carrying Nazi flags using the exact same jargon used, anti-Semitic jargon used as it was used in Germany in the ’30s, accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan and the Grand Kleagle saying, “This is why we elected him,” and a young woman ends up being killed. And I asked the President, “What do you think?” He said something no President has ever said, mark it down, ever said, “There are very fine people on both sides.” 
There have been very powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months. I’ve spent some time more, than one time, with George Floyd’s family and his little daughter, Gianna. And I knelt down to say hi to her and she said in a soft voice, “Daddy,” my word, this is a quote, “Daddy changed the world.” I also got to know Jacob Blake’s mom and dad and the whole family. Know what she said, she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son,” that this nation needed healing, to stop the rioting, peacefully march, but there’s no justification for violence. One of the things that I’ve found, I’ve been in the civil rights arena for a long time and found pretty moving, was Doc Rivers, the basketball coach choking back tears. Remember what he said a couple of weeks ago? “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung,” continuing the quote. “It’s amazing why we keep loving this country and this country doesn’t love us back.” 
Think about that. Think about what it takes for a Black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country that for far too long has never been fully recognized. Trump talks about the lack of systemic racism and this is the first administration we’ve never met, “We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men,” we’ve never met that standard. But every generation has moved closer and closer and closer to inclusion. It’s the first one, elected President, to deliberately try to turn it back in a big way. With all due respect, I think we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, open the lines of communication, and bring us back together to heal and to hope. As President, that’s precisely what I will do. That’s a President’s job, but it just goes beyond the issue of police-community relations. 
It goes about being able to compete and build wealth. It’s about jobs, good paying jobs, financial stability, families of color building wealth, and being able to pass it down, like my Irish-Catholic folks were able to do in Scranton, coming up from nothing. You build home equity, you got something to pass on. For example, another example is more and more women are dropping out of the workforce in this recession whether they’re in a city or in the suburbs. I have a plan to deal with this pandemic responsibly. Testing, tracing, masking, not politicizing the race for a vaccine, a plan for its safe and equitable distribution, providing funding for PPE, the protective equipment and other resources for schools and businesses to be able to reopen safely. If you notice, the president said, when he was asked about his responsibility, he said, “I take no responsibility.” That was a quote. ” I take no responsibility.” 
No national standard has been set by this administration. Mr. Mayor, you’re doing on your own, or with your Governor or others in the community. We have to do so much and we can do so much. Ease the caregiving crisis for so many families experiencing now. That squeeze between raising your kids while caring for an aged loved one. It’s real. Protect your healthcare in the middle of this pandemic. Why do so many Republicans today have time told a hearing on the Supreme Court with 22 days left to go instead of providing significant economic recovery and needs for the people who are hurting so badly, Democrats and Republicans? Think about that. I handled the Recovery Act for our administration. $800 billion in 18 months with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We had an Inspector General who looked over everything I did and I met with once every two weeks. Got $145 billion out to state and localities so you didn’t have to lay off … 
… billion dollars out to state and locality. So you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, school teachers, nurses, first responders. What are we doing? Zip. The house acted, in the beginning of the summer, the so-called Heroes Act, to pay for all of this. States are in trouble. I’ll tell you why they’re not doing anything about it; two reasons. One, it’s all about wiping out the Affordable Care Act, which has been an obsession for this president since he became president. It was an Obama idea. Because no other nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. Not as a judge, [inaudible 00:00:27:59], that’s her view. That’s going to take health care coverage away from 20 million Americans. Because of his mishandling the economy and COVID, we’ve already lost 10 million people, have already lost their employer based health insurance, 10 million. That’s going to take away pre-existing conditions coverage for a hundred plus million Americans. And complications of COVID- 19 like lung scarring as well as heart damage, could well put how many millions more? There’s over 7 million people contracted COVID in the United States. What happens then? Pre-existing conditions can not be covered. It’s going to toss out the rule that allows children to be covered on their parents’ health care until age 26. It’s going to take us backwards. When insurance companies could charge a woman more for the same exact treatment that they charge a man. And pregnancy, once again, becomes a pre-existing condition. Folks, we can do so much better than this. Together we can build on the Affordable Care Act, writing a new health insurance option, a nonprofit public option, which is giving private insurers, a real competitor. Increase the subsidies, so premiums are lower and you can afford plans with lower deductibles, and lower out-of-pocket costs. We can only do any of this, if the country comes together. 
Last week, I went to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to the battlefield where Abraham Lincoln told us that a house divided cannot stand. Today, trust is ebbing, hope seems elusive. Instead of trying to heal his policies are ripping us apart. 
And those Republicans are willing to cooperate, get punished by this president. I refuse to let that happen. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. I know that sounds bizarre in light of where we are. The spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I said that from the time I announced, I was told that, “Maybe that the way things used to work, Joe, you got a lot done before Joe, but you can’t do that anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you and say we can, and we must, if we’re going to get anything done. Democracy requires consensus. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. 
There will be no blue states and red states with me. It’s one America. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who vote against me, as those who voted for me. That’s the job of a president, the duty to care, to care for everybody. We can disagree on policy, but you can still care. And you too have a sacred duty, in my humble opinion. As my friend, John Lewis said before he died, and while he was alive, “You have a sacred obligation to vote.” It matters. Ohio matters. You elected me and Barack in 2008 and 12. 
I’m asking for your support. I want to earn it, I’ll take nothing for granted. Asking for your support for Kamala and me in 2020. I promise we’ll always have your back. So please vote. Go to, I Will Vote.com/OH, now, to request your absentee ballot to vote by mail, to confirm your early voting location, to vote early in person, to find your polling place to vote in person on election day. Just make sure you have a plan. 
As a future congress woman said, “Bring along family, bring long friends, make their plans to vote as well.” No matter what, don’t let anybody discourage you and tell you your voice won’t be counted. It does. And don’t be intimidated by talk of having some of these Proud Boys stand there with their rifles in lines where you can open carry to try to intimidate people without saying anything. You, the American people decide our future; vote. And I’m convinced you’re going to turn out in large numbers. 
When I announced, I said I was running to restore America’s soul. Well its time to restore it. So it’s time to rebuild the backbone of this country, the middle class. This time, bring everybody along. No matter your race, your age, your gender, your religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability; everybody gets to come along. It’s time to unite America. And we’ll do that by choosing hope over fear, science over fiction, truth over lies, and unity over division. There’s nothing beyond the capacity of this nation when we stand together. So it’s time to stand up, take back our democracy, unite. And let’s, for the first time in a while, reflect the values that the vast majority of Americans hold. May God bless you. And may God bless our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
35,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-toledo-ohio-transcript-october-12,"Joe Biden Campaign Speech Toledo, Ohio Transcript October 12","Well, I’ll tell you what. My dad was an automobile man. I got through school, and we got through being able to eat after he lost his job up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. He had to move down to Delaware, because selling General Motors products. So I’ve known, and my state used to have the largest percentage of auto workers of any state in the nation, because we had a small population and the largest General Motors and largest Chrysler plant outside of Michigan and Ohio. I saw what happened when we got hit very hard. We’ve lost both those plants. 
Well, let me start off by saying, Mr. Mayor, thanks for the passport into your city, and Marcy, you’ve been a friend a long time. Thank you for your introduction. There’s no more fierce defender. There’s no more fierce defender, the people she grew up with, than Marcy. She has never, ever, ever forgotten where she came from. She’s tough. She’s a straight shooter. She’s influential in Congress. She’s honest, and she sees you. You’re always in her view. 
Tony, Mr. President, I know you’re new, and he says, “Piece of cake.” So I don’t have to worry if I get elected the first 100 days. But all kidding aside, Tony, thank you for hosting us, and thank you, Local 14. [inaudible 00:26:09], thanks for that introduction. All you did for Barack and me when we were running, when we got elected, jumping in and being part of helping us govern, you remind me of something my dad said. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to say to your kid, look them in the eye and say, ‘Everything’s going to be okay’ and mean it. That’s what a job’s about, a decent paying job like the UAW provides.” 
This lesson I grew up with, surrounded by hard work and families in Scranton and then in Claymont, Delaware, where we had to move when Dad lost work. There was no work in Scranton, just like here in Toledo, but the times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic and the terrible way in which it’s been handled. The economic outlook remains uncertain. Across Ohio and the country, folks are worried about making their next mortgage payment or their rent payment, whether or not they can purchase their prescription drugs or be able to put food on the table, literally worried about whether their kids’ schools open and be able to stay open and, if they’re not open, how they can go to work, if they have a job, and still take care of their kids. 
They see the people at the very top doing better than they ever have while they’re left to wonder, “Who’s looking out for me?” That’s Donald Trump’s presidency, 215,000 dead because of COVID. Experts say we’re likely to lose another 200,000 people in the next few months unless we take some serious action. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, all because this president’s only worried about one thing: the stock market. They refuse to follow the science. It’s estimated that if we just wore these masks nationally, we’d save over 100,000 lives between now and the end of the year. 
This president knew back in January. He was briefed in detail by the intelligence community how extremely dangerous this COVID virus was, how communicable the disease was. He went on a taped interview with Bob Woodward, a leading journalist. It’s on tape. It’s been played, telling Woodward that he knew how dangerous the disease was, but did nothing. Ask yourself, “Why didn’t he tell us? Why didn’t he warn us?” He said nothing. He told Woodward he didn’t want it panic the American people. That’s why he said nothing. 
We don’t panic. America doesn’t panic. But Trump panicked. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis has been unconscionable. The longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he seems to get. Dr. Fauci, the most respected doc on this issue in the world, in the country, he told the president … You know the president’s announcement of his pick for the Supreme Court in the Rose Garden? He’s referred to that as a super spreader. All those people got the disease. 
How’s he responding? Well, guess what? He’s now running an ad you probably saw, a national ad quoting Dr. Fauci out of context. Way back in March, referring to public health officials, Dr. Fauci said, “I can’t imagine that anybody could be doing more,” end of quote. In the recent ad that’s going out nationally, Trump quotes Dr. Fauci is saying that about him, the president. Trump and his campaign deliberately lied, making it sound like Fauci was talking about Trump. Fauci went on to the public air when the ad came out saying, three days ago, “I did not get permission for that quote.” He wasn’t referring to the president. 
Even after that, Fauci said he didn’t say that. The president and the campaign, even after Fauci laid this out, the campaign said, “We’re still going to use it, because he did say it, even though it wasn’t about him.” The point I’m trying to make is it was a knowing lie, like we’re being told about everything about this COVID consequences. As a consequence, through his months of overwhelming lying, misleading and irresponsible action on the part of Donald Trump, how many empty chairs were around your breakfast table this morning? Someone you love, somebody you cared about, someone you knew, a family member or a neighbor, missing, missing. Why? Because of negligence. 
Look, I view this campaign, as I’ve said before and I’ll say it again, between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Toledo and Park Avenue. All Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. That’s why his only metric for American prosperity that he values is the Dow Jones and the index. Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my time with guys like Trump looking down on me, the Irish Catholic kid in the neighborhood, guys who thought they were better than me because they had a lot of money, guys who inherited everything they ever got and still managed to squander it. 
I have to admit I shouldn’t have done it, but I’ve on record saying, and so I’ll repeat it, I still have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about guys like him. I read some stories after I got the nomination that quote, “If Biden gets elected, he’ll be the first non-Ivy League school graduate to get elected in” … [inaudible 00:07:42] it was 80 or 90 years. Guys, have a seat, man. You know what? Like some state school guy who went to the University of Delaware, I was proud of it. Hard to get there, hard to get through in terms of money. But folks, since when can someone who went to a state university not be qualified to be President? 
Folks, I know what it takes to be President. I sat next to a man for eight years, watching and participating. My mom taught me what you’re probably taught by your parents, too. She said, “Joey, nobody is better than you, but everybody’s your equal.” 
I don’t measure people based on the size of their bank account. I don’t respect people based on whether they own a mansion. I don’t judge them based on whether they belong to a country club. You and I measure people by the strength of their character, their honesty, their courage, their courage. My mom used to say, “The greatest gift of all, the greatest virtue is courage. You’re redeemed by your courage.” That’s what she’d say, and redeemed by your loyalty, honesty, loyalty, things that are bigger than yourself or the neighborhoods we were raised in. 
It’s all about family, decency, honor, opportunity. These are the values I learned growing up in Scranton, my guess is you learn growing up in Toledo, wherever you grew up. The people I grew up with in Scranton didn’t have any money in stocks. In our house, growing up, every penny my dad made went to paying the bills, keeping the lights on and food on the table. Every penny our friends in Scranton made went to paying the bills and taking care of their families as well. We looked out for our neighbors. 
That’s why I have a different measure by which I judge the health of America’s economy. I see hardworking women and men who are just trying to earn an honest living and take care of their families, just want an even shot. They’re not asking for anything. They’re just asking for a fair shot, and given a shot, the American people will never, ever, ever, ever let their country down, never. 
The other expression my dad would have, he’d say, “When you see the abuse of power, there’s only one way to respond to it, and that’s with power.” The only power we have to take on corporate America is union power. That’s the only power. I just think back to 2008, when Barack and I were elected and we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in history. The president put me in charge of the Recovery Act, $800 billion. It was needed to save our economy from going into depression. We did it with less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. We were able to see to it that Ohio and other states received substantial assistance to address their economic pain and recover and rebuild, to make sure we kept teachers, firefighters, and cops, public nurses on the job. People are being laid off now because you don’t have the local money to do it. 
So they didn’t have to be fired because of lack of money. That was the federal government stepped up, and it started the longest sustained economic recovery in American history that this guy inherited and then squandered again. But you know what Mitch McConnell said recently about helping the states and cities. He said, quote, “Let them go bankrupt.” Well, I heard that before. You heard it, too. Republicans said the same thing about the automobile industry. 
Like I said, I come from an automobile state, an automobile man. The auto industry that supported one in eight Ohioans was on the brink. It was more than ten years ago, but you remember like it was yesterday. It was on the brink. But Barack and I bet on you and the American worker, and it paid off. I argued the American worker was the finest auto worker in the world. Management screwed it up. You didn’t. You didn’t make the mistake. By the way, it all got paid back. But guess who made the greatest sacrifices? Auto workers. You made the sacrifices to get it back. 
So it’s over the many objections of many that we stepped in and rescued the automobile industry, General Motors and Chrysler, saving one million jobs. Then what happened when Donald Trump came to office? Remember what Trump said in 2017 in Lordstown? He said, “Don’t move,” quote, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house.” But Lordstown shut down on Trump’s watch. 
After a decade in Cleveland, after the debate in Cleveland, I met with an elementary school teacher in Lordstown. Her husband was there as well, one of the workers who lost his job in Lordstown. He had to accept a transfer to a plan in Kentucky, eight hours away, one way, to maintain his healthcare and his pension. He drives 16 hours a weekend to see her and their two kids. 
But Donald Trump’s betrayal doesn’t stop there. He betrayed union workers at Goodyear when he called for a boycott of buying Goodyear tires because of a personal grudge. He passed a tax bill for the super wealthy corporations that actually provided incentives for companies to move jobs overseas. 
Folks, manufacturing is the backbone of America. But we’re in a manufacturing recession because of Donald Trump even before the COVID virus hit. We’re down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and our balance of payments, meaning we’re sending more overseas than coming to us. I mean, we’re buying more overseas than we’re selling, is higher than it’s been a long time. There’s still 10,900 lost auto worker manufacturing jobs in Ohio that did not come back. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Herbert Hoover over 90 years ago, first president of modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came to office. 
Donald Trump’s only plan is more tax cuts for the wealthy. Most of you, if you still have a job, paid more than he paid last year in taxes. $750? Come on. The system’s rigged. We’ve got to change it. $30 billion, a new proposal, just for the gains of the 100 richest billionaires in America, 30 billion. Hear me? They made $30 billion alone in this year, while the rest of the people were getting killed. 
In the middle of this pandemic, why do Republicans have time to hold a hearing on the Supreme Court instead of providing the significant economic need for localities? I’ll tell you why. It’s about finally getting his wish to wipe out the Affordable Healthcare Act, because their nominee has said in the past that the law should be struck down. His relentless effort to eliminate the Affordable Care Act that provided healthcare coverage for 20 million people who didn’t have it, protections for well over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions. We’ve seen his pledge, quote, “to terminate the tax dedicated to financing Social Security.” 
Marcy and I were talking about that. You know what the actuary at the Social Security Department said? If it goes through, this tax, he’s talking about, cut on Social Security, it will actually bankrupt, bankrupt Social Security by the middle of 2023. Go home and tell your parents that. 
Not once has President Trump called for a high-level meeting between Democrats and Republicans in the White House. This is going on now. The House already passed back in the beginning of the summer this [inaudible 00:16:29] to be able to reconcile people in real trouble, get help to states like we did. He had once called a meeting between Democrats and Republicans to deliver the new COVID relief package for working families and small businesses that are going bankrupt. He spent too much time and the bunker of his golf course or in the bunker of the White House than he was willing to actually sit to try to work something out. 
Check it out. First president I can ever remember, in the middle of a national economic crisis, did not try to call the parties together. He turned his back on you. I promise you I will never do that. 
Folks, that’s why my Build Back Better plan is built around a simple concept. It’s time to reward work, not wealth, work. I mean it. An independent analysis by a big Wall Street firm called Moody’s, not a Democratic think tank, they did an analysis of my economic plan to revive this country and an analysis of his. Here’s what they concluded: that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in the next four years, 7 million, more than the president’s economic plan. It would generate economic growth, an additional trillion dollars more than the president’s plan. Look, what these guys don’t get is when you do well, when my family does well, everybody does better. Everybody does better. That’s the God’s truth. 
Here’s how my plan works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. If you make more than 400, beep your horn, because you’re going to get a tax raise. Well, I’m going to raise your tax slightly if you’re making over 400. But look, you’re not going to pay a penny more. In fact, tens of millions of middle class families are going to get a tax cut when they need it most for raising their kids, trying to get affordable healthcare, buying their first home, or saving for retirement. 
But I’m going to ask big corporations and the super wealthy just to begin to start to pay their fair share. I’m going to raise back tax cut he gave for corporate America. They were paying the mid thirties. They’re now paying 21. If we just raise the tax back to what it should be, 28%, that generates over $100 billion. Hear me? That’s money. I mean, excuse me, $1.3 trillion. That’s what it raises to help hardworking folks, to allow us to invest in work and people and grow the middle class and make sure everybody comes along this time. My plan will create a million good-paying union jobs, manufacturing and building products and technology that we need now and in the future. We’re not investing in research. 
It starts with a pretty basic idea. The federal government every year spent $600 billion just making sure that we have ships and planes, cars, trains, all the things the government lets contracts for. Well, I promise you this. Every single product, every single contract let will be only let to a company or a firm that makes it in America from beginning to end. Not a joke. It’s going to be used to buy American products, support American jobs. We’ll invest to build more resilient infrastructure, roads, bridges, ports, 1.5 million new affordable housing units, high-speed broadband in every American household, more important than ever. We’re going to rebuild crumbling schools, retrofit four million buildings, and weatherize two million homes, creating one million new jobs, the reason why everyone from the electrical works and every other major union is strongly supporting us. It’s all going to be done by certified union labor. Promise. 
You may remember when the president put me in charge of that $800 billion, not one single contract went out that wasn’t prevailing wage, not one. So we’re going to end Trump’s new incentive for sending jobs abroad. That’s what he’s done. More jobs are going abroad now. Any company that offshores a job is going to pay a 10% penalty. Any company that brings back a job, reopens a closed factory, like a manufacturing plant, they’ll get a 10% credit for their investment. We’re going to make trade strategy that fights for every American worker and every American job and actually get results, not Trump’s chaotic trade war, erratic tweets, and bluster that’s only stiffed American workers and consumers, including farmers. He’s let you down. He’s let us down. 
I promise you I will stand up to China’s trade abuses, and I will invest in the American worker, because I know no one, nobody can outcompete an American worker when they’ve gotten a fair shot, nobody in the world. 
One more thing: The United States government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We’re going to convert many of them to electric vehicles, and you’re going to still need to build these transmissions for a long time to come. But any new jobs in that area are going to go to people who are in the automobile industry, who are in the manufacturing, who are in the UAW are going to be making these new vehicles, sourced right here in America. The government will provide and demand support to retool factories that are struggling to compete. The US auto industry will step up. I’ll expand capacity so the United States, not China leads the world in modern new technology. 
We’re going to make it easier for American consumers to move to the vehicles of the future by building a network of 500,000 charging stations across the country. We’re offering consumers rebates to swap older fuel-efficient cars. We’re going to move in a direction that technology is taking us and making sure UAW leads the way in how we do it. Together, this will mean one million good new jobs in the auto industry. 
Folks, it’s an example of how we can do anything. I’m more optimistic about what we have a chance to do in the next four to six years, eight years, than anything anytime in my whole career. The blinders have been taken off the American people. They see what the combination of the pandemic, the economic crisis, the racial inequality refacing, and what’s going on internationally, and they’re ready to step up. They know we have to change. 
Nothing, nothing, nothing is beyond the capacity of the United States of America, and I mean that. Think about it. We’re the only country in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went in because of who we are. As I’ve said to other world leaders, never underestimate the American people. There’s no quit in America. There’s none. In America, we can do anything that we need to do if we can do it together. Nothing can stop us. 
We have to come together. That’s why I’m running. I ran as a proud Democrat for the Senate. I had run as a proud Democrat for Vice President, and I’m running as a proud Democrat for President. But I promise you this. I will govern as an American president. I’ll govern for every one who voted for me, as well as against me. We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. So vote. Vote. Visit iwill.com/ohio. God bless you. God bless the auto workers. God protect. Thank you. Which way am I going?"
36,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-erie-pennsylvania-speech-transcript-october-10,"Joe Biden Erie, Pennsylvania Speech Transcript October 10","Hello, hello, hello, hello. Thank you, thank you, thank you. It’s good to be back in Erie. I want to say hello to all of Erie. But mainly Mr.Mayor, City Council President Horton, and all local elected leaders who are joining us here today. And to your next Senator, Julie. We need to turn out and support for Democrats down the line here in Pennsylvania and win back that Pennsylvania state Senate. Folks, look. I want to thank you President McManus for coming out, you’ve been a good friend a long time. And for everyone at the UA for hosting this incredible training facility. I’m so grateful to have earned UA’s endorsement. You have over 355 proud plumbers, pipe fitters, and more behind me then I can possibly thank you for. 
Also, want to thank Rick for sharing his story with us today. And for being part of a conversation this year where he shared a story with America. And Rick, Delaware is thought of as being a great corporate entity, and chemical facilities, and all those things. But we have a $4 billion, as you probably well know, agricultural industry in the Delmarva Peninsula. It’s a big deal and a lot of farmers are being hurt really badly, really badly. Farmers all across the country have been gutted by the president’s broken promises and reckless trade war. But our farmers, just like our union members and anyone who actually does an honest day’s work, see him and his promises for what they are. Rick, I want to thank you. And I think you put it best in the op-ed you wrote last year. You said, “It’s a bunch of hot air and cold wind.” 
Folks, this is it. Election’s here. The choice couldn’t be more stark. The stakes couldn’t be higher. So many Pennsylvanians are facing hard times right now. After my debate in Cleveland last week I took a train. That’s what I’ve ridden a lot, an Amtrak train. From northeastern Ohio into Pittsburgh and Greensburg, Latrobe, Johnstown. And I heard the same stories everywhere, I’ve been hearing all around the country. You’re trying your best but it never feels like enough. You’re not looking for a handout. You’re just looking for a fair shot. That’s how my dad felt when we had to leave Scranton after it was no work, when coal died. He was in sales, he wasn’t a guy who was in the coal mines. Although my great-grandfather was, they tell me, the first Irish Catholic State Senator ever elected in the state of Pennsylvania, and he was a mining engineer. But I remember him saying he made that walk, which a lot of you know here in Erie. 
I call it the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell his kids we can’t play in that ball camp, can’t play in Green Ridge Little League anymore. You can’t go to St.Paul’s, you got to leave. Dad doesn’t have a job. I’m going to have to leave. I remember him taking us home, my mom and three children at the time, home to my grandpop’s. And I don’t know how much pride it must’ve cost him to ask my grandfather, “Will you take care of Jean and the kids? I’ll be back.” And he started commuting every weekend 157 miles down to Delaware where he had grown up. We ended up in a steel town called Claymont, Delaware. Then we went to Wilmington. My dad got a sales job and he worked hard. Took about four years to build a decent middle class life and be able to buy a home. 
But it wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. He said, “Joey, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I at least expected them to understand my problems.” America deserves a president who understands what people are going through. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them. More than 210,000 are dead, as was pointed out. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people a day, dead. The president was told a little while ago… When he was told a 100,000 people a day were dying, you know what he said? He says, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because he is who he is. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected, and counting. 175,000 cases right here in Pennsylvania. My heart goes out to all those families who, like any of us have lost a child’s spirit, look at that empty chair at the dining room table tonight where somebody you love used to sit. 
My heart goes out to everyone struggling in this economic crisis. Simple neglect on the part of this administration. There’re 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis and still have not come back. Temporary layoffs have turned into permanent layoffs. We’re still down 674,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started, and more than 40,000 manufacturing jobs here in Pennsylvania. The Trump presidency will be the first presidency since Hoover that is going to end up leaving office with fewer jobs than when he came into office. Since Hoover. But President Trump has laid… He talks about this V recovery. We went down real quick, we’re coming up quick. Well, that’s what you call a K-shape recovery. Those folks on the top of the K are doing very, very well. Recession at the top, those folks, everything’s going up for them. But everybody in the middle and below is going down, seeing things get worse. 
It means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in American history. And it means while the top… This is a fact, which is startling to me when I found it out. The top 100 billionaires, in the middle of this pandemic they made $300 billion additional dollars. Hear me now? 100 individuals made $300 billion this year. And what’d the bottom half get? They got the K, they got the slide down. Because the fact is, the President can only see the world from Park Avenue. I see it from Scranton. I see it from Claymont, for real. You all know what I’m talking about. You all see it from Erie. That’s why my program to build back better is focused on working people. 
Think about it. Think about all the people you know who got up this morning and had the following conversation. “Honey, I know we need four new tires, they’re bald. But we can’t do it now, we got to wait. You got to wait.” Or “I know we just lost our insurance, but we’re going to be okay. We’re going to hang in there.” Or having to make a choice, literally a choice, between getting the prescription or putting food on the table. If I said to that 10 years ago you’d look at me like I was writing a fiction story, but that’s the truth. Those are decisions people are making today, right now. 
Independent analysis put out by a highly respected Wall Street firm of all things, Moody’s from Wall Street firm, projects that my build back better plan’s going to create 18.6 million jobs in four years. That’s harder now. That’s not a liberal think tank, that’s Moody’s. And it’s going to create seven million more jobs than the president’s economic plan. And a trillion dollars more in economic growth than the president’s plan. And here’s how it works, I’m going to raise taxes. I’m not going to raise taxes on anybody making less than $400K, but you won’t pay a penny more. But those making more than that, I’m going to ask them to finally begin to pay the fair share. I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to begin to pay. 91 of the fortune 500 companies today pay zero tax. You hear me? Zero tax. How many of you pay zero tax? And billionaires are paying at a tax rate… Because it’s all investment money, they’re paying a lower tax rate than you pay if you have a job as a plumber. 
How can that be? So I’m going to raise. The money I’m going to raise, we’re going to allow us to invest in working people and grow the middle-class back, and make sure everyone comes along this time. My plan is about making the kinds of investments that are going to stimulate economic growth. To get it back to full employment fast and help us build back better than before. We’re going to create millions of good paying union jobs. I had the honor of being the guy in charge of the Recovery Act when the Great Recession occurred. The president turned to me, he used to love doing it at State of the Union messages. He’d never tell me what he was going to do. And he turns, says “And Joe, sheriff Joe’s going to take care of that $800 billion.” 
Well, we got it done less than two tenths of 1% waste or fraud. And we built back the longest expansion in American history. Manufacturing and technology, making sure we’re going to make the future made in America. And infrastructure, building: airports, schools, affordable housing, upgrading the water and pipes. Making sure it’s sustainable and resilient, built, laid down by union plumbers and pipe fitters here in Pennsylvania and across the country. And clean energy, we’re going to upgrade four million buildings with weatherization of two million homes. And it’s estimated that’ll create one million good paying jobs, union jobs. Union jobs to be filled by men and women like in this local here. Look folks, we’re in a situation now where if you take a look at this build back better… I’m going to take a second. But I hope I don’t take too many seconds before it rains here. 
Number one, we were talking about it, Mr.President, a little while ago. He promised an infrastructure plan in 2016, ’17, ’18, ’19. He didn’t do a damn thing. Not one single bit. He promised to relieve main street slammed by the recession. But guess where that money went, that the Congress passed? It went into the Mar-a-Lago crowd, the wealthy. See, I’m not joking. It didn’t go to small businesses. It didn’t go to the people that needed it. My plan to revitalize American manufacturing infrastructure says we’re going to use by American. We’re supposed to be only buying American now. 
Well, I’m going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure and clean energy. We’re going to raise over $3.7 trillion by eliminating that tax cut for the super wealthy. And folks, we’re going to: fix water pipes, pipelines, replace lead pipes, upgrade treatment plants. We’re going to construct 1.5 million new affordable housing units. We’re going to build a $100 billion dollars rebuilding our schools. We’re going to retrofit, which we started in our administration, 4 million buildings; including advanced heating and cooling system. There’s going to be such a race to job creation for unions that you’re not going to believe it, and I really mean this. And by the way, when I did the Recovery Act, which is $800 billion, not one… We had the largest infrastructure project short of Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway Program; since that. 
Not one single solitary dollar went to anything other than a prevailing wage. Had to be a prevailing wage. Look, I’m also going to make sure that corporate America being so kind, wanting to take over registered apprenticeships… You know what that’s all about? You guys spend a quarter billion dollars a year making sure that you have apprenticeships that are the best trained people in the world. Well folks, I’m also going to pass the PRO Act. They’re spending over $2 billion a year trying to keep you from being able to organize around the country. That’s a promise. And also strengthen labor standards, especially OSHA rules. There’s a lot we can do, but it’s not enough to praise workers. We got to make sure they get benefited. 
Folks, look, my dad had another expression. After he lost his job, we moved to Delaware. He’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay.'” The fact is that every time the word climate change comes up Donald Trump thinks hoax. Every time it comes up, I think jobs. Let me be clear, no matter how many lies he tells, I am not, not, not banning fracking; period. We’ll also increase incomes. We’re going to see the burden and the cost with an increased 50, we’re going to make sure. Not prevailing wage. We can’t mandate that, you guys. By the way, I said inside, the other expression my dad had was, “There’s only one way to deal with the abuse of power.” Which corporate America is exercising now. “It’s with power.” And the only power we have is union power. You’re the guys that keep the ball bearings on the other side of the gate from taking everything, and that’s a fact. 
So look, I’ll try to move along quickly here. The fact is that we not ease the burden on the major costs in your life. What’s the average middle-class person fear most? They’re trying to tear down the Affordable Care Act. We’re going to build on it, adding a new health insurance option. A not-for-profit public option, which is going to give private insurers real competition. We’re going to increase the subsidies so premiums are lower and we can afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. Because we’re going to be able to do that with the money we take back from the super wealthy. We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. 
Look folks, we’re going to work with states to ensure that every three, four, and five year old has access to free high quality preschool, not daycare. You send them to preschool, there’s evidence of 58% of them will go all the way through. No matter what their background. No matter what poor school, poor neighbor they come from. You start them at age three, they have a 58% better chance of graduating all the way through high school and beyond. We’re going to make sure the low and middle income families will never have to spend more than 7% of their income caring for their young. What’s the comp… Talk to the women around here. I was a single dad for five years. I couldn’t afford help. I thank God I had my mom, and my sister, and my brother to help me with my kids when my wife and daughter were killed. 
We’re going to make four year public college and universities tuition free for families making less than $125,000 a year. And when Erie gets his first new community college to open in Pennsylvania in 27 years, we’re going to make sure that it’s free for anyone who qualifies to get in. That’s a fact. And by the way, that costs a lot of money. That costs $6 billion a year. That’s about as much as we give a tax deduction for race horses. I mean this, we got to have priorities. 
If you’re buying your first home? Look at all people who’ve gotten out of school since the 9/11 generation. Where they got out of high school without a graduation. Where they got out of college, no graduations. Where they thought they had these good jobs waiting for them, but they all got shut down in the Great Recession. And now, what are they doing? They’re unable to make that first home down payment. They’re out there busting their neck. And a lot of them are college graduates, some of them are beyond that. Some of have their graduate degrees and no jobs, or no access. Well, I’m going to make sure you get a tax credit for up to $15,000 for your first time home buyer; period. That’s going to provide you a down payment. We’re going to protect social security, increase benefits for millions of seniors. So he can retire with dignity in some respect. 
Folks look, but if we’re going to get anything done, we’ve got to come together. We’re going to have to vote like we’ve never voted before. Early voting is open here in Pennsylvania. So go vote if you can. And go to IWillVote.com/pa to find out when and where you can vote early. And if you requested a mail in ballot, return it as soon as possible. Make sure you seal it first in the secrecy envelope, and then sign the declaration on the outside of the envelope before you return it. As I said early this week on the sacred grounds of Gettysburg battlefield, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. I’m going to work as hard for those who don’t support me as those who do. 
And I’m so proud in this campaign to have earned the support of so many proud and patriotic Republicans, including Pennsylvania’s former governor and secretary of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge. I want to thank him publicly for his endorsement. We may not in everything. We agree on this. This is a moment to put country above party. Because after all this country’s been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years we’ve stood as a beacon for the rest of the world. It cannot be that here in the year 2020 we’ll allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish on this earth; as Lincoln said. We can do better. We can do better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. 
All this division being pushed by this president, all this stuff about encouraging… Here in the debate we had I ask him to condemn the Proud Boys. He said, “Stand back and stand down, but stand ready.” What’s going on here? This is not who we are. This is not who we are as a country, for real. We can argue like hell, but end of the day we come together. I am more optimistic about America’s chances today than I ever been. Why? Because I think the blinders have been taken off, people have realized what’s really at stake here. I think we can pull this together. I’m optimistic. I really genuinely am. 
But here’s the deal guys, we got to go out and make sure you vote. Because, the only way we lose this is by the chicanery going on relative to polling places. This whole idea… Not a single solitary reasonable person in either party has said mail-in ballots are corrupt. No evidence, but he’s trying to make it sound that way. Trying to put people in polling places. The same guys you saw standing blocking people’s way in Virginia with banners and rifles slung across their shoulders. Folks, it’s not who we are. We’re so much better than this. So I say to you all, God bless you all. Let’s go out and vote. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank you. Where am I going? Am I going this way? Thanks everybody. See you pal, thanks a million. Thank you! The other way, [inaudible 00:20:11]."
37,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-las-vegas-speech-transcript-october-9,Joe Biden Las Vegas Speech Transcript October 9,"… a widow and a dear friend of an American hero, John McCain. We also saw the resilience and the goodness of decency of the American people. They’re not looking for a handout, they just want a fair shot. My dad used to have an expression when he lost his job up in Scranton. When I was in grade school, my dad would say, and we had to move in with my grandparents. When he went down south from Scranton to Wilmington, Delaware looking for a job. And he used to always say that, “The fact is Joey, I’m not looking for government to solve my problems but I hope like hell they can at least understand my problems.” He finally got a job, we could afford to buy a small home. He worked hard to build a decent middle class life. It wasn’t easy for him, but he had an expression. 
As I said, a job joy about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s being uable to look your kidney eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.” You deserve a president who understands what you’re going through. Who sees you where you are and where you want to be. The last thing you need is a president who ignores you, looks down upon you, who just doesn’t understand who in God’s name we are. That’s President Trump. His reckless personal conduct since his diagnosis. The destabilizing effect it’s having on our government is unconscionable. He didn’t take the necessary precautions to protect himself or others. And the longer Donald Trump is President, the more reckless he gets. How can we trust him to protect this country? 
Governor, you’ve seen how he picks fights with states and pits them against one another. Look, what’s happened. More than 210,000 Americans are dead. 420,000 have been hospitalized. We lose anywhere from 700 to a thousand people every single day in America, worse than any country in the world. More than 7.5 million Americans have been infected. And we’re still counting. And here in Nevada, there have been more than 82,000 cases in total. More than 1,600 deaths. 80% of those deaths have been seniors over 60 years of age. Black, Latino, Asian American, Native-American communities are especially hit hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Latinos is almost three times higher than that of white non-Latinos and the death rate as well as three times higher. More than 40,000 Latinos have died from COVID-19. My heart goes out to all those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair around the kitchen table. Or go to dinner tonight and the person that should be there is gone. 
They’ve lost part of their soul. They’ve lost part of their life. It’s all about family. With you and I it’s all about family. Losing family is a devastating thing. We can do so much better. My heart goes out to everyone struggling with the economic crisis caused by the neglect, the simple neglect of this President. Nearly 11 million jobs lost since the beginning of this crisis. And they still haven’t come back, including 136,000 jobs here in Nevada. Temporary layoffs have turned to permanent layoffs. Record growth last month and a number of Americans facing long-term unemployment. And the problem of long-term unemployment, once you get beyond a certain point, history shows us that they never get a job again. 
All told, there are now 30 million workers who either lost hours, lost paychecks, or lost their jobs entirely. Roughly 700,000 people have dropped out of the labor force last month. And the vast majority were women. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis has started. And our balance of payments deficit is going up. And here in Nevada, the unemployment rate is 13.2%, the highest in the nation because of President Trump’s negligence. The hospitality industry has hit particularly hard. The culinary union, has recently said publicly that 50% of their members are still out of work. Tourism in June was down 70% from a year ago. The result? President Trump will be the first president in modern history since Hoover to leave office with fewer jobs than he had when he came into office. Here in Nevada, after seeing over 200,000 jobs created in the last seven years of the Obama-Biden administration, Nevada has actually seen jobs go down under the Trump presidency. He’s leaving us with what he calls, he says is a V-shape recession. 
It’s a K-shaped recession where those at the top keep going up and the middle-class and everyone else keeps going down, getting worse. Means essential workers who sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. You get this, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just in the pandemic, the top 100 billionaires have made an additional $300 billion, top 100. But you get the bottom half of that K and it’s a downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table. So much food insecurity in America, in this state. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher for your kids because of the negligence of the President, they can’t go back to school because they haven’t provided the wherewithal for schools to open. 
You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home where the risk of COVID are kept outside. That’s because you’re a police officer, a firefighter, a nurse, or you’re working on an assembly line in customer service or a checkout counter, or here in Vegas in hospitality. If you’re a housekeeper, a casino worker, the ones who built this very stage. Governor Sisolak, your members of Congress are doing everything they possibly can to help turn things around. Governor, you’ve been focused and responsible. You followed science and put public health and safety. You made tough calls that saved lives. Working around the clock so we can reopen schools and the economy safely. Your members of Congress, have done the same. 
And the House passed what they call the HEROES Act months ago. Would have provided billions of dollars to help states keep first responders on the job. The safety measures needed, the PPP needed to open our schools and businesses but Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, Republican leader did nothing to move the legislation. Nothing in June, nothing in July, nothing in August, nothing in September, things getting worse and worse and worse. And as people struggled and suffered, what did they focus on? If this wasn’t so serious, you’d think I’m making it up. What they focused on is more tax cuts for the wealthy, not a joke. They’re proposal adds another $30 billion tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Cuts in funding. Cutting the means by which we fund the Social Security system, leading the actuary of Social Security to say if they do it, by 2023, mid-2023, there’ll be no money for Social Security. 
And a relentless effort to eliminate, as Alejandro said, the Affordable Care Act, which provides healthcare coverage for 22 million people, over 100 million with pre-existing conditions. This is going on at the same time he’s already cost 10 million people their health insurance because their companies have gone bankrupt. It’s unconscionable. Instead of focusing on our needs, your needs, he’s trying to take your healthcare away. He’s literally before the Supreme Court as I speak to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act, take away that healthcare for 20 million Americans. That’s 282,000 Nevadans. Take away federal protections for preexisting conditions, 1.2 million Nevadans. And complications from COVID like lung scarring and heart damage could well become the next pre-existing condition. Striking down the Affordable Care Act would toss out the rule that allows our children to be covered on their parents’ insurance policy until age 26. Take us backward when insurance companies could change a woman more for healthcare than a man for the same procedure, just because she’s a woman. Take away Medicare benefits for seniors. Increase their drug prescription costs. 
And just as he vowed to “terminate” as I said earlier the funding for Social Security. The idea that in just a few years could put at risk 410,000 Nevadans that rely on a dignified retirement because of Social Security. And during all this, not once did President Trump call a high-level meeting of Democrats and Republicans to the White House to resolve these issues. I’ve served with a lot of presidents, never, no matter how good or bad you thought they were did they fail to try to bring parties together in the White House to reach a settlement. You know why? He spent so much time hiding in the bunker in the White House or on the bunker of his golf course, playing hundreds of rounds of golf. 
And then this Tuesday, what’d he do? He said, “End the discussions.” He wasn’t even starting them. No more negotiations. No more negotiations. And now today he says, “Well, I’m back.” One thing for sure, Donald Trump shows no urgency to deliver hardworking Americans, like the family I grew up in. Like all of you. What they need now desperately. For exactly two months since the emergency small business program that your congresspeople voted, for has closed down two months of small business owners in Nevada and across the country, waiting, hoping, for just a little extra help to be able to stay open. Now we have more than 400,000 small businesses have been permanently closed. 
By the way, the largest employers in America are small businesses. Millions more are struggling to hang on. How many more will go under? How many more dreams will be extinguished because of the selfishness of this President and the Republican leaders in Congress? Make no mistake, if you’re out of work, if your business is closed, if your child’s school was shut down, if you’re facing eviction, as millions are, over 20 million Americans worry about whether they’re going to be able to pay their mortgage next month. None of that seems to matter to Donald Trump. You’re a firefighter, police officer, who depends on state and local budgets. He’s turned his back on you as well, because they’ve got to balance their budgets. They’re being laid off all over America. 
When Barack and I were elected, we inherited the worst recession short of the Great Depression in history. He put me in charge of what’s called the Recovery Act. $800 billion. We passed and needed to get out into the economy within 18 months to prevent a depression. We did it with less than two tenths percent of waste or fraud. And I was able to see to it that the states in order to keep moving, keep teachers, firefighters, first responders, all employed. I was able to get $140 billion in aid out to the states. Right here in Clark County, I was able to bring to $1.2 billion to keep your economy going. We have that ability now. 
The House has already passed a similar piece of legislation. And we started the longest sustained recovery in American history. But you know what Mitch McConnell said about help with the states. I’m not making this up. He said, “Let them go bankrupt. Let them go bankrupt.” What in the hell is he talking about? Folks, we’re so much better than this. We can turn this crisis into progress. We contain this virus and fully reopen our economy. We make up 4% of the world’s population and we have 20% of the world’s deaths. If we just follow the science, expand testing and tracing, social distance, washing our hands, implementing nationwide mask mandates. Don’t politicize the race for a vaccine, Mr. President. Just have a plan for safe and equitable distribution. 
On the economy, bring the Congress back together to pass real relief to help people who’ve lost their unemployment checks as well. And then implement a comprehensive agenda that I’ve laid out to make bold investments so we can build back better. He keeps talking about the Republicans. Some Republicans, a lot of them are acknowledging and supporting me, but a lot of them also are talking about, “Well, Biden’s going to spend all this money.” Well, guess what? The independent analysis put out by Moody’s, a Wall Street firm did a detailed analysis of my recovery plan and the President’s. And here’s what they said, it’s off of Wall Street, that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs in four years. 7 million more jobs than the President’s plan. And $1 trillion more in economic growth than the President’s plan. 
Democrats know how to get things done. Here’s how my plan works. It’s not going to raise a penny in tax for anyone making less than $400,000 a year. Not a penny. And how am I going to pay for all this? I’m going to ask the big corporations and the wealthy to start paying their fair share. You realize that the Fortune 500 companies, 92 of them making billions of dollars, don’t pay a single penny in taxes. It’s wrong. Donald Trump paying $720 in taxes? Come on. The money we raise by eliminating the $1.3 trillion of his $2 trillion tax cut that affects the super wealthy and corporations, we’re going to invest in working people. We’re going to grow the middle class to make sure everyone’s included on the deal. 
The kinds of investment that will stimulate the economy, including industries like tourism and hospitality. To get back to full employment fast and help build back better than before. It means the analysis shows creating millions of good paying union jobs. Manufacturing and technology. Making sure our future is made in America. We and the President in the White House gives out $600 billion in contracts per year. Well guess what? While I’m President, it’s going to go to no outfit that doesn’t make it in America, the whole thing, and sell it in America. I mean it. 
And infrastructure. Building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports, and clean energy. Upgrading four million buildings and weatherizing, two million homes, creating at least a million good paying jobs in the process. Making the climate safer, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. We’ll deal with climate change by creating millions of union jobs that build a climate resilience of our cities and our towns fighting back stronger, more frequent wildfires. Beating heat waves, droughts, hurricanes, and floods. By the way, did you hear what the President said about hurricanes this summer? He was told about how they’re coming across the warm water in the Atlantic and the closer they get to the shore, the worse they get. You know what he said, Alejandro? He said, “Maybe we should drop an atomic weapon on them and blow them up.” As we say in my religion, “Bless me father for I have sinned.” What’s going on here? 
Under my plan, small business come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. We’re going to get $50 billion in new capital, especially for minority owned businesses and small businesses. We’re going to make another hundred billion dollars in low-interest loans available to these businesses, creating jobs, increasing economic growth and increasing incomes. A $15 minimum wage. I’m dreaming here. But a $15 minimum wage for our essential workers. We’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you with a good wage. Ensure you have strong benefits. We’ll ease the burden of the major cost in your life. We’ll build the Affordable Care Act, writing knew health insurance options, not for-profit public options, which give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies for premiums and lower your costs. Increase plans that will lower deductibles and lower out of pocket expenses. And we’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry with a plan that will slash costs of prescription drugs by 50%. 
The reason I’m not going to more detail, you’ve been out here a long time, let’s give me one example. If in fact Medicare is able to negotiate for all the drugs they buy and say you’re not going to be able to sell them to them unless you pay the price we’re suggesting, that would drop by 60% the cost the cost of drugs. 
We’ll also make high quality childcare available and accessible. We’ll work with the states to ensure that every three, four year old will get access to free, high quality preschool. Not, not, not daycare. We’re going to make sure low and middle income families never have to spend more than 7% of their income to care for young children. Because if we truly want to reward work in this country, we have to ease the financial burdens that created the care for families that are caring for raising a child and an aging loved one. Look at the professional caregivers out there, home health care workers, childcare workers, who are more often women. Women of color immigrants, are too often underpaid, under seen and undervalued. That’s why my Build Back Better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiving workers and early childhood educators. We’re also going to triple the funding for Title I schools like the one behind me here, which served high number of children from low-income families. 
We’re going to make four years of public college and universities tuition free for any family that makes less than $125,000 a year. We’re going to make community college and job training programs free for all hardworking Americans that qualify. And if you’re buying your first home, we’re going to provide a $15,000 tax credit to help you get there. We’re going to protect Social Security. Increase benefits for millions of seniors. Look, I’m not going to lay it out, but go to joebiden.com. Go to Moody’s, look it up. We pay for all this and we grow the economy at the same time. 
The fact is, President of the United States can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks Wall Street built this country and CEOs. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont. Communities like some that you live in. I know the middle-class working people built this country. The measure of economic success has been what our families are talking about around the kitchen table. Are you able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay?” 
How many times do you know somebody… This morning I had to say, look, I know those tires are bald, but you got to ride on them for another 20,000 miles. We just don’t have the money. We just can’t do it now.” Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to school because we can’t continue to borrow the money to keep her in that community college? There was a discussion that took place around my table and I’m sure yours as well. But if we’re going to get anything done, we got to come together. 
I made a speech I worked really, really hard on and thought really hard about before I made it in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on the battlefield last week. I said at that time that we’re facing a crisis, not unlike we did after Gettysburg. I said there that I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to govern as an American president. The work is hard for those who don’t support me as those who do, because after all this country has been through, after all that America has accomplished, after all the years, we stood as a beacon of light to the world we cannot be that here and now, in 2020, we allow the government, the government of the people, by the people, and for the people, to perish from this earth. 
Folks, we have it our hands. And I made this in the bottom of heart, we have in our hands the ultimate power. And what’s the ultimate power in a democracy? The power to vote. Here in Nevada, the best thing you can do is vote early and return your ballot quickly. Ballots here in Clark County were mailed two days ago, on Wednesday. You can return your ballot by mail. You can drop it off at a drop box or vote in person during the early vote or on election day. But just make a plan. Seriously, go to iwillvote.com/nv. Make a plan. Don’t risk any delays, return that mail and ballot as soon as you can. Make sure your voice is heard. 
We can be better than what we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. I’m confident we can bring Democrats and Republicans together again with him gone. Folks, conclude by saying there has never, ever, ever been anything the United States has been unable to accomplish when we’ve done it together. Never, never, never. So folks let’s stand up and vote and take back this country now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. (silence)"
38,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-community-center-visit-las-vegas-transcript-october-9,Joe Biden Community Center Visit Las Vegas Transcript October 9,"I’ll tell you. And I asked her, “Is that my sister?” I said, “Yeah, yeah.” Look, the thing I love about being here, and it’s been about a year since September I was here last at this very spot, is the one thing we have in common. I mean, this sincerely. I first ran for the United States Senate years ago and I had one billboard. It said, “For all our families.” For real, that’s all it said. All my literature, “For all our families.” And the thing I love about you all, it’s all about family. It’s about family. It’s about family and faith and loyalty, and that’s what I think every time I think you here. And so I want to thank you. 
Now, I’ll tell you what, Edgar planned on bringing in 20 horses in here, but he couldn’t get them in today. Tell you what, I’ve had people campaign for me but never had them go through the neighbors with me on horses. But my dad, who was a real equestrian, would have really been flattered to know you’re doing this. Folks, look, it’s great to be back at the center and I don’t have to tell you all, there’s so much at stake. And here we are, we’ve gone through so much since I was here last, because of the incompetence of this administration. 210,000 people dead. We’re in a situation where that’s 40,000 Latinos nationwide, 40,000. 30 million people lost their jobs. Three million Latinos lost their jobs. One in three Latino businesses have closed, and the deep racial injustices that Trump continues to fan the flames of. It’s just wrong. We have to end this cycle where in good times, you’re being left behind. In bad times, you’re the first in trouble, and as we come out, always the last to come out. 
This crisis, we have I think though an enormous opportunity to build back better. I’m going to be very short, so I’m not going to keep you standing very long. Don’t worry. But I really feel strongly about this. I think we’re in a circumstance where you all understand it, but the American public is beginning to understand it. You are the core of the American story. You have a potential. You’re already an economic powerhouse, but the potential to lead the country in the 21st century into the direction that we need to go. You have close to 20% of the population in the United States, 24 out of every 100 kids in grade school through high school are Latino, and it’s ridiculous that we continue to policies that this administration has moved forward on and not embrace that and see it as our future. I’m not trying to be solicitous with it. I’m not trying to be nice. You are the future of the country. I mean, you really are. 
If, in fact, we’re in a situation where the Latino community in the United States of America and the GDP, the wealth that they generate nationwide, if we just took just the Latino population, you’d be the eighth largest economy in the world, in the United States. Why can’t we see that the future is just absolutely breathtaking if we just use our heads and begin to operate in a way that I think the American people are ready to do? The blinders have been taken off the American people. They get it. They understand. They understand that all those folks in the front lines, look at how many dreamers are out there risking their lives? I mean, you know it, but the American people don’t know it, and I keep telling them all over the country. The dreamers, there’s thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of them risking their lives, making sure that people are staying alive, they can stay home. 
And so, folks, look, we’re going to be in a situation where we can’t make this, we can’t do it without you all. We cannot win without the community. And I’m going to say something somewhat self-serving about you all. The fact is you can determine the outcome of this election, not just, not just for President, but for the Senate, for the Congress. And that’s the biggest mark, the single most consequential thing anyone can do is vote. And when you vote and they add it up and they see who delivered the vote, that’s the thing that guarantees significant input on what happens next. So folks, early voting starts. The clock is ticking. Voting starts here in just eight days on the 17th and I’d encourage you to tell all your friends. Go to Iwillvote.com now. Make sure they’re registered, their addresses are up to date on the ballot, and they have a plan to vote in the early voting right here, right at this spot. 
So come back next weekend, bring your family, and bring five friends. I really mean it. Bring other people with you, because he’s trying to scare us. He’s trying to convince everybody there’s ways they can play with the vote and undermine the vote. They can’t. If we show up, we win. And look what’s happened in early voting all across America. Long lines, long lines. We can’t just win, we have to win overwhelmingly, so he can’t be in a position where you can put the phony challenges that he’s talking about. So, folks, the American people, they’re the ones who decide our future, not this President and Attorney General, who is less than straightforward. You’re the ones. So let’s get out and vote. I know the sun is hot. I don’t want to keep you standing. And I want to thank the elected officials. This we call a bus man’s holiday. That means when a bus man has a holiday, he has the day off, the guy driving, he doesn’t get back on the bus. 
Well, these folks are all on the bus. They’re elected officials. They’re another elected official. I can’t thank you enough for your support. I give you my word I will do everything in my power to deliver on all that I’ve said. I mean it from my heart. You are family. Family and faith are what’s driven this community and is going to drive this country. And so, folks, let’s go get them. This is off. I guess I should have stayed where I was. My grand pop was not Hispanic. He was an Irishman. And every time I’d walk out of his door up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d say, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grand mum, when she was alive, would yell, “No, Joey. Spread it!” Let’s go spread the faith, okay? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. By the way, I promise you, if I win, you’re getting an invitation to Washington, okay? Not a joke, not a joke. Thank you. You’re the best."

Hi. Where’s Vanessa? Where are you? Thank you, Vanessa. Thank you so very much for that introduction and for your leadership and all you do for the community here in Phoenix. Thank you. It’s good to see everybody. It’s good to be in the House of Labor. Earlier today, Joe and I had a chance to visit the American Indian Veterans National Memorial and pay tribute to the native Americans who have served our country in uniform. We were joined by the great Cindy McCain, a longtime friend of Joe’s and someone I greatly admire. And I was fortunate to serve with John McCain in the United States Senate and what an incredible, incredible American. He was a patriot of the highest order. And Cindy is supporting our campaign, isn’t that great? And she’s doing it because she knows that Joe and I will always do what she and John did, and that’s put our country first. So we thank Cindy. 
We’re so excited to be here in Arizona today. And later today, we’ll stop and talk with workers and small business owners who are working so hard and doing everything right, but still struggling to get by. They are who I was thinking about last night at the debate. This election, more than any other in our lifetime, will affect every part of our lives, with consequences that may last generations. And there is so much at stake. Our nation is at a crossroads. Just think, all at the same time, we are experiencing the pandemic, the recession, a reckoning on racial justice, a changing climate that’s battering our coastlines and setting the West on fire, and the future of health care hangs on top of it all, because you see President Trump is in the Supreme Court right now, trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. 
And along with Senate Republicans, he’s trying to jam through a Supreme Court Justice who will do exactly that, who will rip away protections from as many as 2.8 million Arizonans with preexisting conditions, 2.8 Arizonans with preexisting conditions. And while this president, of course, didn’t bring the virus to our shores, his reckless disregard for human life and for the wellbeing of the American people has allowed it to spread the way we have seen, and the casualties have been enormous. And so let’s not make any mistake. His refusal to contain this virus is what has wreaked havoc on our economy. And I know folks are hurting, but I also know this. We can overcome these challenges if we elect Joe Biden as our next president. 
And here’s the thing. Joe has had a plan for COVID at least since March. He’s been talking about this. He knows what this means and the kind of leadership that is required to get on top of it and get in control. Joe knows these things. Even, and you guys may have seen the debate last night, even when Joe didn’t have the briefing that Donald Trump and Mike Pence had on January 28th, Joe knew, because of experience, that this could be serious. And under his leadership, we will contain this virus and save lives and build our economy back better than before. Joe will- 
Back better than before. Joe will be a president who restores the soul of our nation. He’ll be a president who creates good paying jobs and eases the burden on working families. And above all, Joe will be a precedent who unites the American people, Democrats, and Republicans, and independents, old and young, from all backgrounds and races, to meet the greatest challenges of our time. And I plan on being right by his side, and we’ll be ready on day one. We’ll be ready on day one. But here’s the thing, Arizona. We need your help. We’ve got only 26 days left. So let’s not wake up the day after the election on November 4th, wishing we’d done more. Let’s organize and vote in numbers no one has ever seen before. Let’s send Mark Kelly to the Senate. 
Vote like your life depends on it, because right now, it really does. And yesterday, Arizona, vote by mail ballots were shipped to homes across this state. And in-person early voting has started, including at the new McDowell Square voting center, just about a mile from here. So be a first week voter. A first week voter. And there are four ways to vote in Arizona. You can vote by mail. You can drop off your ballot at a dropbox. You can vote early in person, or you can vote in person on election day. And to learn more, go to, iwillvote.com/az and make a plan. Write down when, where, and how you will vote. And tell everyone you know to do the same, because Arizona’s future, America’s future, is in your hands. So let’s elect Joe Biden as the next president of the United States of America. And ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you the great Joe Biden. 
Hello, Arizona. It’s great to be back. It really is. It’s great to be back. Thank you, Kamala. Thank you, [Vanessa 00:03:08]. Appreciate it very, very much. And we met backstage, and the first instinct we all had was to hug each other. And we went, “No, no. We got to stay 12 feet apart.” But folks, I want to give a special thanks to Ruben Gallego for being here. And you’re a big deal, man. I’m serious. And I notice he did something that… This is what we call, in our business, a busman’s holiday, coming to hear another politician speak, and having to put a tie on when he shows up without a tie. But thank you very much. I appreciate it, pal. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the president and COO of the Southwest Regional Council, Pete Rodriguez. Where are you, Pete? Is he in here, or is he back in his office? Wherever he is, I want to thank him- 
Not here now? Well, also so Fabian Sandez, president of the local 1912. And you’ve all been with me. We were talking, Kamala and I, coming down the hall, and we said… Not a joke. It was just purely coincidental. She said, “I love the carpenters.” She said, “The first outfit that endorsed me when I ran for attorney general for-” 
DA. 
“… the DA in San Francisco, were the carpenters.” And I said, “I remember mine well, a guy named Cal [McCullough 00:00:15:29], president of the Carpenter’s Union from New Castle, Delaware, one of the 350 year old city on the Delaware River was the first one to endorse me as well.” And so, you’ve been with me my whole career, and president Doug McCarron has been a long time friend. We’ve worked together a long time. 520,000 carpenters. That’s an incredible army to have behind you. And you are, I’m telling you. You have, my whole career, and I hope you know I’ve had years as well. There’s an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. It said, “You go home with them that brung you to the dance.” Well, the carpenters brought me to the dance, and you’re going home together. You’re going to have a seat at the table. 
Folks, people who shaped the skyline, who build the foundations, everything rely on, the carpenters. Labor brought me to the dance. And the only reason I’m able to run for president is because, standing here today, because of labor. I’ve never forgotten everything you’ve done for me and you’ve done for the country. I really mean it. I get in trouble for saying this, but it’s true. You’re the backbone of America. You’re the spine of America. You’re the ones who actually built the country, not Wall Street, bankers, and CEOs. You’re the ones who are going to rebuild it again. You’re going to build it back better, for real. Kamala and can’t thank you enough. And folks, I don’t know if you caught it, but the senator had a heck of a night last night. I tell you what, you got to give me a great credit for knowing how to pick them. Right? I couldn’t be prouder. She’s like a younger sister. 
I couldn’t be prouder to be running alongside such a leader with remarkable character and vision. And who always, always, always is looking out for the people, always somebody else, not her. Always. And I want to tell you something, Kamala and I are about to kick off a tour, visiting businesses in this community. Small businesses in this community and all communities are more responsible for more jobs than… In the community, local small business owners… They’re busting their necks, than the major corporations. You add it all up, for real. Small businesses create more jobs in America than the major corporate entities. And this community has found itself having to go through some really challenging times, and I need not tell the congressman that. He’s forgotten more about it than most people know. 
And like Chef Silvana. Chef Silvana owns two restaurants here in Phoenix. She had both. When they were struck by COVID, she had to close one of them down. And she’s working hard to keep the other one afloat, Barrio cafe, which we’re going to be visiting later this afternoon. But it isn’t easy. The loan Silvana was able to secure back in the spring because of the legislation passed by the Democrats in the House, helped her for a little while, but it wasn’t nearly enough. She’s scraping by week to week, trying to look out for her 10 employees, some of whom have been with her for decades. And on top of that, she’s facing, and I have permission to say this, she’s facing a terminal disease. Silvana had to cancel her own health insurance after finishing a round of treatment recently just to make ends meet. It’s devastating, and it’s heartbreaking, and it’s wrong. 
Every American should be upset about what Savannah is going through. I think you all are. I know I am. Because I know, we know, it didn’t have to happen. If they had just done what you passed, just move forward. And then, I’ll talk about it in a minute. But Silvana’s story is increasingly common story for Arizona workers and small business owners. Too many Arizonans are facing hard times right now. They’re trying their best, but it never feels like it’s enough. You’re not looking out for a handout. They’re just looking for a fair shot. Just want an even shot. That’s all they’re looking for. And that’s how my dad felt when he couldn’t find work in Scranton when coal died, he had to move on. I remember him taking us, what I call the longest walk any parent has to make up a short flight of stairs to tell their kid, “Honey, I’m sorry, but you can’t go back to St. Paul’s. You can’t go play in that little league anymore. Dad’s lost his job. There’s no job here. I’m going to have to move.” 
I remember him taking us to our grandpop’s house. Me, and my brother, and my sister, and my mom was certainly going to have another child. And we all went home. I thought about how hard it must’ve been for my dad. So many people in this town have done the same thing. Have to go to his father-in-law, the father of four boys and a girl, and say, “I have to ask you a favor.” I know how much pride it cost him. “Can you take care of them for a year? I’ll be back. I promise. I’ll come home every weekend.” It was only 159 miles, but it seemed like the end of the world. But he went down, and by the time he was able to get a good job, a job enough to get us an apartment in a place called Claymont, Delaware. Because he had been raised in Wilmington, Delaware. He ended up, then, getting a good job, a decent job, managing a car dealership. He worked hard to build a decent middle-class life. And it wasn’t easy for him. He had an expression. He’d always say, and really, I mean this sincerely… He said, “I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in hell expect them to at least understand my problems. Just to understand them.” And America, I think, deserves a president who understands what the American people are going through, who sees who you are, what you want to be, who cares about your health, your prosperity, your dream, your American dream. You’re facing real challenges right now. And the last thing you need is a president who exacerbates them, who ignores you. And I’m going to say it. I’ve been saying for a while. It’s my perspective from Scranton. A president who looks down at us, who thinks that if you put your life on the line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker. 
… line for the nation, you’re a loser, a sucker. As we were talking about with Cindy, my Beau, my son Beau who just passed, not just, passed away, now it’s going on five years, it seems like yesterday, won the Bronze Star and [inaudible 00:22:16] Service Medal. He was a volunteer. [inaudible 00:22:20] but he volunteered. He had to get an exception to be able to go to Iraq for a year. And I promise you, he wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He, like all the veterans we met with this afternoon alongside Cindy McCain, they’re Patriots. They’re people understand that being an American is about recognizing there’s some things bigger than yourself. 
Cindy’s husband, John McCain, who I had the great privilege of him asking me to do his eulogy, we used to argue like hell. We were like two brothers. We’d fight like hell, but we always, always, always ended up together. And that’s how it used to be. It used to be that way across the board. He wasn’t a loser. They’re all heroes. And you know what? They deserve better than a president who will say anything to deflect responsibility for any mistake he makes. I don’t know whether you noticed, he recently said that, they asked him where he got the COVID, he said, “I probably got it from Blue Star parents.” They’re people who lost a child in battle. He said, “Because they like to get close to me and hug me. I don’t know how to say no.” 
Look, we’ve paid too high a price already for Donald Trump’s chaotic, divisive leadership. More than 210,000 Americans have lost their lives to this virus. We lose more every single day. Now, these 6,000 Arizonans have been lost. I mean, 6,000 gone, gone. More than 220, 000 Arizonans have been infected with COVID. 122,000 jobs in Arizona still haven’t come back. Nine times more Arizonans are on unemployment each week than before this crisis hit. But businesses like Silvanna’s restaurant are closing, schools aren’t back to normal, because Donald Trump can’t focus on what matters. When the House passed the so-called Heroes Act, that’s that second big package they passed to get people on their feet again some time ago, but the President and Mitch McConnell did nothing to move the legislation. 
A lot of cities and states are going bankrupt because they have to balance their budgets. Our founders are pretty smart. The reason they wrote the Constitution the way they did is the Congress, the Senate, the House, the government could deficit spend in order to compensate for being able to make sure we got out of the hole. Trump is spending more time, I’ve been calling on this, as you probably know for the last four months, he should get out of his bunker and out of the sand trap from his golf courses. Not a joke. I mean, think about it. He never once, I’ve been around a while, he never one single time tried to bring Democrats and Republicans together in the White House to try to get a settlement. Not once. You can’t name me a President in the lifetime of any of you that refused to deal that way in the middle of a crisis. But the leadership of Congress together to resolve the issue is something that wasn’t on his watch. 
And on Tuesday, Congressman, I’m sure you were probably not surprised by it, but on Tuesday he announced he’s walking away from negotiations to provide additional relief for working people, mom and pop businesses, schools. Just go down the line. On October 8th, exactly two months since the Emergency Small Business Program was closed, two months of small business owners in Arizona and across the country waiting and hoping for just a little bit of help to be able to stay open, more than 400,000 small businesses are permanently closed nationwide, 400,000, millions are struggling to hang on. The legislation has already been passed. It’s there. I handled what they called the Recovery Act when we inherited a great recession. I had the ability to deal with $800 billion spent in 18 months. All the outside groups pointed out less than two-tenths of 1% waste or fraud. But do you know what we did? We provided $ 148 billion to the cities and states so you didn’t have to lay off cops, firefighters, sanitation workers. 
You didn’t have to lay off nurses, close down county hospitals. You kept it open. And America got through it and began to generate the longest period of recovery in modern history. How many more have to go under? How many more dreams have to be extinguished because this President threw in the towel? Instead of focusing on your needs, he’s still trying to take away your health care. I mean, think about that. Just think about it. I’m not, but if I were a playwright, I’m writing a play, you’re in the single solitary outfit on Broadway that would take it, because it sounds like ridiculous fiction, in the middle of a pandemic, when already 10 million Americans have lost her employer based insurance because the employer went under, he’s trying to take away insurance from another 22 million people who got it for the first time in the pre-existing conditions that the Senator talked about. 
He’s in the Supreme Court right now asking you to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the entirety of it, take away Medicare benefits for seniors. People don’t realize how deep this goes, and taking us back to a time when insurers could deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition. I want you to understand this. Women’s rights, I’m not talking about the right to choose now. Women’s rights, do you realize, before we passed, Barack and I passed the law, pregnancy was considered a pre-existing condition. Not a joke. Insurance companies were allowed to charge more for a woman for the same exact medical procedure than a man would have. Same one. And look what’s happened. Minority communities were devastated. But he’s done beyond that. He’s vowed, and this isn’t even get much attention because so much chaos is going on, he vowed to “terminate the funding source for social security.” That’s the holding tax you pay for social security, six and a half percent. He wants to terminate it so it makes it look like you got more in your paycheck. 
But the actuary at the Social Security Department said, “If he does that, social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. Benefits for more than a million Arizonans rely on the whole idea of a dignified retirement.” The fact is President Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He thinks that Wall Street built America. That’s why he let big corporations jump in on the front lines and get the recovery money that the Congress helped pass while small businesses struggled to stay open. But people don’t know because it’s so complicated, so much is happening. The Congressman can tell you. There was an Inspector General that they appointed, meaning somebody who had independent capacity to look into anything that was being done on the money being spent. I had an Inspector General overlooking the $800 billion I was responsible for. Twice every two weeks, I met with him in detail so we knew exactly where the money was going. 
What’s the first thing the President did? He fired the Inspector General. Think about that. 40% of all the money that was supposed to go to small businesses in the first time around went to the Mar-a-Lago crowd. The wealthy. I mean, if this wasn’t so true, I’d be reluctant to say it because it sounds so bizarre. This President has forgotten the people he said he’d fight for it. I’ll never forget because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont, a little steel town. I know that the middle class, working class built this country, and unions built the middle class. And I measure economic success on what families are talking about sitting around their kitchen tables, about having a decent job and benefits, about keeping their small business dream alive, about the conversations that took place this morning. But we need four new tires. The tires are bald on the car. We’ve got to wait. We can’t afford to get them. Can’t do it. Who’s going to tell her she can’t go back to the community college because we just can’t borrow any money anymore? 
Or you have 20 million people today, 20 million people including here in Arizona, who are worried about whether they can pay this month’s mortgage payment. 20 million. And look at all the people who are worried they’re going to be thrown out in the street because they can’t pay their rent. These guys provided for all that. But nothing. Being able to look your kids in the eye. My dad would just said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it. And mean it.” 
It would be okay. And mean it, and mean it. Well, that’s what Kamala and I are focused on, to say to our kids, “Honey is going to be okay.” That’s what we’re talking about. We’re going to get this virus under control. We’re going to reopen safely and strongly creating good paying jobs and working to end this era of rancor and division. Because if we’re going to get anything done, we have to do it together. I’ve been saying this since I announced and people thought I was being naive. They said, “Oh, you got a lot of things done, Joe, before, but that was the past.” Well, guess what? If we can’t bring the country together, we’re dead. This is a democracy. It depends on a consensus. You’ve got to bring people together. 
It’s somewhat maybe presumptuous of me, but I made a major speech. I worked really, really hard on for a long time in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. And I did it two days ago. And I talked about, in Lincoln terms, that we have to bring America together. We can’t hold grudges. I’m running as a proud Democrat with a capital D, but I will be an American President, not a Democratic president. I’ll work as hard for those who didn’t support me… I promise you and look at my record… As those who did support me. Because the fact is that’s the job of a President. It’s a duty to care for everybody, not just who voted for you. After all we’ve been through, all America’s accomplished, all the years we’ve stood as a beacon to the world, we cannot allow ourselves to remain divided. 
We have the ultimate power in our hands. You know what that power is? That little sticker you have on, the power to vote. Really, you can still register here in Arizona to vote. Early voting has already begun. And the vast majority of Arizonan’s vote by mail. And those mail-in ballots will start arriving in the next couple of days. So Kamala and I are saying to you, the best thing you can do is return your ballot quickly. Don’t risk delays. Return that mail in ballot as soon as you can and make sure your voice is heard, because if your voice can overcome and go out and vote, your voice through your vote can overcome every one of the challenges we face. 
And by the way, you know what they’re setting up. They’re setting up the argument that these votes aren’t going to matter. You saw what happened today. The FBI arrested a group of militiamen who had a plan to go in and to kidnap the governor of Michigan. You’ll see it in the news tonight, the governor of Michigan. Remember those guys with the assault rifles standing in her driveway? And the President is saying things in my debate with him, like “To the proud boys and all white supremacists group, stand down, but stand ready.” This is serious stuff. We can’t just win by a vote. 
We’ve got to all turn out. We can be better than we’ve seen. We can be what we are at our best. If we all get out and vote. And on our best we’re the United States of America and all can decide. It’s not some prosaic thing. The fact is America’s never, never, never, never, ever failed. We’ve stood up together. We’re the only nation in the world that’s come out of every single crisis… war or economic crisis… stronger than when we went into the crisis. So folks, I’m more optimistic today about America’s chances at home and in the world than I’ve ever been. 
I’ve been around a long time. I’ve worked with a lot of Presidents. I really mean it. We have a chance. A chance not only to improve our country, but to change the world. We have the most powerful military in the history of the world, but that’s not why the rest of the world repairs to us. It’s not the example of our power. It’s been the power of our example that has the rest of the world follow us. And that example is being trashed around the world. As the Senator said last night in the debate, it’s true. 17 major countries of the world are asked what leaders did they admire the most and trust the most? The Pugh Foundation, I think. You know what they said? More people trusted Xi Jinping of China and Putin of Russia than the President of the United States. That was profound security as well as economic impact. 
So folks let’s not quit. There’s no quit in America. We have never, ever, ever, ever, ever quit. And if we need you to stand up at any time in our history, we need you now. Thank you for being here. God bless you and may God protect our troops. Thank you."
40,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-gettysburg-campaign-speech-transcript-october-6,Joe Biden Gettysburg Campaign Speech Transcript October 6,"Thank you all for being here. Thank you. I appreciate you being here on this gorgeous day in a magnificent, magnificent setting, until you think about all the lives that were lost here. Please, all have a seat. 
On July 4th, 1863, American woke to the remains of perhaps the most consequential battle in American soil. It took place here on this ground in Gettysburg; three days of violence, three days of carnage, 50,000 casualties, wounded, captured, missing, or dead, over three days of fighting. When the sun rose on that Independence Day, Lee would retreat. The war would go on for nearly two more years, but the back of the Confederacy had been broken. The Union would be saved. Slavery would be abolished, government of by and for the people would not perish from the earth, and freedom would be born anew in our land. 
There’s no more fitting place than here today in Gettysburg, to talk about the cost of division. About how much it has cost America in the past, about how much it is costing us now, and about why I believe in this moment, we must come together as a nation. For President Lincoln, the Civil War was about the greatest of causes. The end of slavery, widening equality, pursuit of justice, the creation of opportunity, and the sanctity of freedom. 
His words would live ever after. We hear them in our heads. We know them in our hearts. We draw on them when we seek hope in hours of darkness; “Four score, and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” Here on this sacred ground, Abraham Lincoln, re-imagined America itself. Here, a president of the United States spoke of the price of division, and the meaning of sacrifice. 
He believed in the rescue, redemption, and rededication of the union. All this in a time, not just of ferocious division, but of widespread death, structural inequity, and fear of the future. And he taught us this, a house divided could not stand. That is a great and timeless truth. Today, once again, we are a house divided, but that my friends can no longer be. We’re facing too many crises. We have too much work to do. We have to bright a future to have it shipwrecked on the Shoals of anger and hate, and division. 
As we stand here today, a century and a half later after Gettysburg, we should consider again, what can happen when equal justice is denied, when anger and violence and division are left unchecked. As I look across America today, I’m concerned. The country is in a dangerous place. Our trust in each other is ebbing. Hope seems elusive. Too many Americans see our public life, not as an arena for mediation of our differences, but rather they see it as an occasion for total, unrelenting, partisan warfare. 
Instead of treating each other’s party as the opposition, we treat them as the enemy. This must end. We need to revive the spirit of bipartisanship in this country. A spirit of being able to work with one another. When I say that, and I’ve been saying it for two years now, I’m accused of being naive. I’m told, “Maybe that’s the way things used to work, Joe, but they can’t work that way anymore.” Well, I’m here to tell you they can, and they must if we’re going to get anything done. 
I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I’ll work with Democrats and Republicans. I’ll work as hard for those who don’t support me, as those who do. That’s the job of a president; the duty to care for everyone. It was a lot of Democrats and Republicans to cooperate with one another is not due to some mysterious force beyond our control. It’s a decision. It’s a choice we make. 
And if we can decide not to cooperate, we can decide to cooperate as well. That’s the choice I’ll make as president. But there’s something bigger going on in this nation than just our broken politics. Something darker, something more dangerous. I’m not talking about ordinary differences of opinion, competing viewpoints give life and vibrancy to our democracy. No, I’m talking about something different, something deeper. Too many Americans seek not to overcome our divisions, but to deepen them, we must seek not to build walls, but bridges. We must seek not to have our fist clenched, but our arms open. We have to seek not to tear each other apart, we seek to come together. You don’t have to agree with me on everything, or even on most things, to see that we’re experiencing today is neither good nor normal. 
I made the decision to run for president after Charlottesville. Close your eyes, and remember what you saw. Neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK coming out of the fields with torches light, veins bulging, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile herd across Europe in the ’30s. It was hate on the march, in the open, in America. Hate never goes away, it only hides. And when it’s given oxygen, when it’s given an opportunity to spread, when it’s treated as normal and acceptable behavior, we’ve opened a door in this country that we must move quickly to close. As president, that’s just what I will do. I will send a clear unequivocal message to the entire nation, there is no place for hate in America. 
It will be given no license. It will be given no oxygen. It’ll be given no safe harbor. In recent weeks and months, the country has been riled by instances of excessive police force, heart-wrenching cases of racial injustice and lives needlessly and senselessly lost, by peaceful protesters, given voice to the calls for justice, by examples of violence and looting and burning that can not be tolerated. I believe in law and order, I’ve never supported defunding the police. 
But I also believe injustice is real. It’s a product of a history that goes back 400 years, the moment when black men, women, and children first were brought here in chains. I do not believe we have to choose between law and order, and racial justice in America. We can have both. This is the nation strong enough to both honestly face systemic racism and strong enough to provide safe streets for our families and small businesses. The two often bear the brunt of this looting and burning. 
We have no need for armed militias roaming America’s streets, and we should have no tolerance for extremist white supremacy groups, menacing our communities. If you say, “We should trust America’s law enforcement authorities to do the job,” as I do, then let them do their job without extremist groups acting as vigilantes. If you say, “We have no need to face racial injustice in the country,” you haven’t opened your eyes to the truth in America. 
There’ve been powerful voices for justice in recent weeks and months, George Floyd’s, six year old daughter, who I met with, who looked at me and said in her small child’s voice, “Daddy changed the world.” Also, Jacob Blake’s mother was another. When she said, “Violence didn’t reflect her son and this nation needed healing.” And Doc Rivers, the basketball coach, choking back tears when he said, “We’re the ones getting killed. We’re the ones getting shot. We’ve been hung. It’s amazing [inaudible 00:13:49] we keep loving this country and this country does not love us back.” 
I think about that. I think about what it takes for a black person to love America. That is a deep love for this country. That has for far too long, never been recognized. What we need in America’s leadership that seeks to deescalate tensions, to open lines of communications, to bring us together, to heal, to hope. As president, that’s precisely what I will do. We paid a high price for allowing the deep divisions in this country to impact on how we deal with the Coronavirus. 210,000 Americans dead, and the number’s climbing. It’s estimated that nearly another 210,000 Americans could lose their lives by the end of the year; enough, no more. Let’s just set partisanship aside, let’s end the politics and follow the science. 
Wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Social distancing isn’t a political statement. It’s a scientific recommendation. Testing, tracing, the development and all approval and distribution of a vaccine, isn’t a political statement. It is a science-based decision. We can’t undo what has been done. We can’t go back. We can do so much better. We can do better starting today. We can have a national strategy that puts politics aside and saves lives. 
We can have a national strategy that will make it possible for our schools and business to open safely. We can have a national strategy that reflects the true values of this nation. This pandemic is not a red state or blue state issue. This virus doesn’t care whether you live, or where you live, what political party you belong to, it affects us all. It will take anyone’s life. It’s a virus. It’s not a political weapon. 
There’s another enduring division in America that we must end, the division in our economic life. That gives opportunity only to the privileged few. America has to be about mobility. It has to be the kind of country where an Abraham Lincoln, a child of the distant frontier, can rise to the highest office in the land. America has to be about possibilities. 
The possibility of prosperity, not just for the privileged few, but for the many, for all of us. Working people on their kids deserve an opportunity. Lincoln knew this. He said that the country had to give people, and I quote, “An open field and a fair chance. An open field and a fair chance.” That’s what we’re going to do in America. We’re going to build together. We fought a civil war that would secure a union that would seek to fulfill the promise of equality for all. 
And by fits and starts, our better angels had prevailed again, just enough, just enough against our worst impulses to make a new and better nation. And those better angels can prevail again, now. They must prevail again, now. 100 years after Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg, the vice president, Lyndon B Johnson also came here, and here’s what he said. 
He said, “Our nation founded soul and honor in these fields of Gettysburg, we must not lose that soul in dishonor, now, on the fields of hate.” Today, we’re engaged, once again, in the battle for the soul of the nation, the forces of darkness, the forces of division, the forces of yesterday are pulling us apart, holding us down and holding us back. We must free ourselves of all of them. As president, I will embrace hope, not fear. Peace, not violence. Generosity, not greed. And light, not darkness. I’ll be a president who appeals to the best in us, not the worst. 
I’ll be a president who pushes toward the future, not one who clings to the past. I’m ready to fight for you and for our nation every day, without exception, without reservation, with a full and devoted heart. We cannot, and will not, allow extremest and white supremacist to overturn the America of Lincoln and Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglas, to overturn the America that has welcomed immigrants from distant shores, to overturn the America that has been a Haven and a home for everyone, no matter their background. 
From Seneca falls to Selma, to Stonewall we’re at our best when the promise of America is available to all, we cannot, and we will not allow violence in the street to threaten the people of this nation. We cannot and will not walk away from our obligation to at long last, face the wrecking on race and racial justice in this country. We cannot and will not continue to be struck in the partisan politics that lets us, this virus, thrive, while the public health of this nation suffers. 
We cannot and will not accept an economic equation that only favors those who have already got it made; everybody deserves a shot at prosperity. Folks, duty and history call presidents to provide for the common good, and I will. It won’t be easy. Won’t be easy. Our divisions today are long standing, economic and racial inequities have shaped us for generations, but I give you my word. I give you my word. If I’m elected president, I will Marshall the ingenuity and Goodwill of this nation to turn division into unity and bring us together because I think people are looking for that. We can disagree about how as we move forward, we must take the first steps. It starts with how we treat one another. How we talk to one another. How we respect one another. 
In the second inaugural Lincoln said, “With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we’re in to build up the nation’s wounds, bind up the nation’s wounds.” Now, we have our work to reunite America. To bind up our nation’s wounds. To move past shadow and suspicion. And so we, you and I together, we press on, even now. After hearing the second inaugural address, Frederick Douglas told President Lincoln, “Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.” We have to be dedicated to our own sacred effort. The promise of Gettysburg and the new birth of freedom was in hand. 
I think it’s at risk. Every generation that’s followed Gettysburg has been faced with a moment when it must answer this question, will they allow the sacrifices made here to be in vain, or be fulfilled? This is our moment to answer this essential American question, for ourselves and for our time. And my answer is this, it cannot be that after all this country has been through, after all that America’s accomplished, after all the years, we have stood as a beacon of light to the world. 
It cannot be that here and now in 2020, we will allow the government of the people, by the people, and for the people to perish this earth. No, it cannot. And it must not. We have it in our hands, the ultimate power. The power to vote. Its the note instrument ever devised to register our will in a peaceable and productive fashion. And so we must. We must vote. We will vote. No matter how many obstacles are thrown in our way, because once America votes, America will be heard. 
Lincoln said, “The nation is worth fighting for.” So it was. And so it is, together as one nation under God, indivisible. Let us join forces to fight the common foe of injustice and inequality, hate and fear. Let’s conduct ourselves as Americans who love each other, who love our country, who will not destroy, but will build. We owe it to the dead who were buried here at Gettysburg. We owe that to the living, and to future generations yet to be born. 
You and I are part of a covenant, a common story of divisions overcome and hope renewed. If we do our part, if we stand together, if we keep faith with the past and with each other, then the divisions of our time will give way to the dreams of a brighter, better future. This is our work. This is our pledge. This is our mission. We can end this era of division. We can end the hate and the fear. We can be what we are at our best, the United States of America. God bless you all. And may God protect our troops. Thank you. We can do this."
41,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-miami-campaign-speech-transcript-october-5,Joe Biden Miami Campaign Speech Transcript October 5,"Good afternoon, everyone. It’s great to be back in Miami. And thank you, Esther. I told you our family has been, unfortunately, this considerable consumer of healthcare. Please all sit down. Of healthcare and I’ve learned from personal experience as my sons, my daughter, my wife, family has learned if there are any angels in heaven, they’re all nurses, male and female. Docs let you live and nurses make you want to live. I really mean it. They’re there at the tough times. And by the way, thank you for your service in the military, but also thank you for the beginning of this pandemic. 
Being a surgical nurse wasn’t easy when there wasn’t the PPE available to all of you as you walked into those operating rooms and dealt with all the problems. I know my son-in-law’s a physician surgeon in Philadelphia and the stories at the beginning of this process, when we should have had everything available. So thank you not only for your skill and your courage, but your bravery and doing what you’ve done. And I want to thank you for the care dedication that you went on, all your fellow SEIU members, all your nurses that show up and struggle with illness or coping with the loss of a loved one in terrible times. 
So many of you had to hold a phone to a patient’s ear to say goodbye to a family member because they couldn’t be there. They couldn’t see them in the hospital as they passed. Now, I want to thank Victoria, Victoria for sharing her family’s journey with us today. Victoria and I were talking a little bit earlier. I was in South Asia speaking with a president and he asked me what made America unique? And I said immigration because it’s the history of this country. And he looked at me funny. He said, why is that? 
And I said, because almost everybody who’s come here, other than those who came in chains 400 years ago came because they’re escaping something and it took enormous courage. I really mean this. Think about it, enormous courage to leave everything they knew, everything that was familiar, sometimes leaving family members to get on a boat, a plane, train, whatever the means was to be able to leave and start a new life. And to do that, you have to have optimism, courage. You have to be resilient. You have to be willing to believe you can make things change for the better. 
That’s what’s built this country, immigration. We are, not figuratively, it’s a phrase used to not often fully appreciated, a nation of immigrants. That’s why we’re the most unique and strongest nation in the world. It’s family like yours and Esther’s that have made this country what it is through the hard work and faith and perseverance. The richness and beauty of Miami is built from the connections of family, culture, values that we share with our friends throughout the Caribbean and Latin America. Earlier this afternoon, I visited Little Haiti. 
Had been some years since been there when the earthquake occurred and I came to deliver some assistance to the Haitian community, as well as making sure we had temporary protective status granted. It’s a cultural complex and now here at the site name for one of Cuba’s most celebrated poets and thinkers. This city is living proof of the incredible strength that we draw from families and communities from every culture choosing America. So thank you, Victoria, for choosing us and I’m really honored that you’re going to vote for me in your first election. 
I promise you I will not let you down. I promise you I will not let you down. And let me also say at the top, my prayers continue to be with the president and the first lady for their health and safety as they like so many American families are dealing with COVID-19. I was glad to see the president speaking and recording videos over the weekend. Now that he’s busy tweeting campaign messages, I would ask him to do this, listen to the scientists, support masks, support a mask mandate nationwide, require a mask in every federal building and facility and interstate travel, urge every governor, mayor to do the same. 
We know it saves lives. His administration just rejected a mask mandate for public transportation on Friday. The CIA came along and said, we need to be protected and they said, no. I believe that was wrong and not very rational experts say that universal masking could say between now and January 100,000 lives. Let me say that again. Between now and January, mandatory masking could save 100,000 lives. I backed that mandate months ago. He should back it now. Since the president entered the hospital on Friday, since Friday, more than 100,000 more people have been diagnosed with COVID. 
And this week, at least 5,000 more will die. Cases and deaths are climbing in many states. I hope the president’s recovery is swift and successful, but our nation’s covered crisis is far, far from over. Today, my prayers are with the families of the 210,000 Americans who died from the virus. All those families who got up this morning and there was an empty chair at the breakfast table, tonight, an empty chair at the dinner table where one should be, husband, wife, son, daughter, mother, father. And nearly 7.5 million Americans- 
And nearly 7.5 million Americans have been infected with the virus to date. This pandemic and economic collapse has hit the Hispanic communities, particularly hard. Nationally, the infection rate among Hispanics is almost three times higher than white, non Hispanics. More than 40,000 Hispanics have died from COVID-19, devastating families and close knit communities of loved ones. And here in Florida, where Hispanics make up about one quarter of the population, they make up 37% of the COVID deaths. 
Nearly 3 million Hispanics are unemployed. If you break that down, that last data, unemployment for Hispanic women and Hispanic youth actually went up last month. One in three Hispanic, small business owners have taken a hit and many are likely to have to close permanently. Some economists are calling this what they call a K shaped recovery. It means those at the top, they keep going up, their income. But everyone from the middle and lower-income, it keeps going down, keeps getting worse. Means that essential workers, so many of whom are Hispanic, have sacrificed to keep us going through this pandemic are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern American history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a shocking statistic, but it’s true, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just since the COVID crisis they have made an additional $300 billion. The top 100 additional made an additional $300 billion. Everyone else though, they got the bottom half of that K, downward, a downward slide. 
You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay your bills, put food on the table, pay the rent, or if you’re lucky enough to own a home, will you have enough money to pay the mortgage? How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids, because their school has gone remote. You’re asked to risk your neck if you can’t work from home, while the risk of COVID are mostly kept outside, because you’re one of our first responders, a union nurse like Ester or on an assembly line, or working in a customer service or tourism industry or at a checkout counter or police office, firefighter. I know this isn’t an easy time, but I also think this pandemic has just helped us rip off the blinders in this country as how inequitable so many things are. People didn’t even realize, and so now they’ve seen it. 
I truly believe we have a tremendous opportunity to turn this moment of crisis in a moment of great progress for the country. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to build them back, make bold investments in them so we can build back better than before the crisis. 
An independent analysis, President talks about… he loves talking about Wall Street. He never talks about Moody’s on wall street that pointed out, they did a detailed assessment of my economic plan and his. And here’s what Moody’s concluded. They projected my economic plan will create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more jobs in the president’s economic plan will in four years and $1 trillion more in growth than the president’s plan. 
And here’s how it works. I’m not going to raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. You won’t pay a penny more. I guarantee you. But I’m going to ask the big corporations and the super wealthy to begin to pay their fair share. It’s not punishment. It just about time you start paying your fair share. The money we raise from making sure they pay their fair share will allow me to invest it in working people on a growing middle class. 
When I announced I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of this country. Working folks, the middle class. They weren’t built by wall street. It was built by labor. Advance racial equity across the economy to make sure everyone is included in the deal this time. We’re going to invest it in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs in manufacturing and technology, making sure our future is made in America. In infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, and airports like I was able to do when I ran the Recovery Act for our administration, putting billions of dollars in the Port of Miami, creating so good, hard working people with good decent union jobs, able to accommodate the new supertankers coming through the canal, generating some stability. 
My plan will make sure Hispanic communities benefit from hundreds of billions of dollars in investments, to fill the cracks in the sidewalks, install broadband, close the digital divide, create spaces to live, work, and play in safely. 
And clean energy. We upgrade 4 million buildings, weatherize 2 million homes. We’ll create, at least, the estimates are at least 1 million good paying jobs and save us millions and millions of barrels of oil. We’re going to meet the threat of climate change and invest in strengthening climate resilience, where we are already dealing with an existential threat of climate change. I don’t have to tell you in Miami, don’t have to tell you in South Florida or in my state, which has the lowest sea level, lowest degree of height from sea level than any state in the nation. Stronger, more frequent hurricanes, rising tides, flooding. And no matter where the president says, maybe you should consider dropping an atomic weapon on a hurricane coming our way is not a good idea. It doesn’t work. Look, that’s not some distant future in Miami or South Florida. You’re dealing with it right now. What do you have to do to get knocked in the head to understand it? 
We’re going to make sure the small businesses could come out the other side of this crisis with access to capital and the ability to deal with their debts. My plan will get $50 billion in capital flowing to small businesses, which would get repaid in employment and taxes, especially minority owned small businesses and make another $100 billion in low interest loans available to those businesses to get back on their feet and stay alive, because you know as well as I do, and ethnic communities, they are the heartbeat, they’re the center of a community. Whether it’s a grocery store, a beauty shop, the barbershop, the hardware store, the essence of a community. We’re going to make investments to increase incomes as well. It’s long past time. I’ve worked with Governor Cuomo to get it done in New York and other governors across the country. No one should have to work two jobs to be able to be 40 hours a week, so they’re above the poverty rate. $15 should be a minimum wage in the United States of America, period. 
And for our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to begin to pay you a good wage, be sure you have strong benefits. We’re going to ease the burden of the major costs in your life. What are they? Healthcare. We’re going to build on the Affordable Care Act, which gave 4 million Hispanic people in this country health insurance, by adding a new health insurance option, a not for profit public option. We’re going to give private insurers a real competitor. We’re going to increase subsidies, so your premiums are lower and you can and afford plans with lower deductibles and lower out-of-pocket expenses. 
We’re going to take on the pharmaceutical industry, a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs by 60%. You think I’m making these numbers up. If we just let Medicare negotiate independently for all the drugs they purchase, I promise you the rates are going to fall through the floor. Affordable and accessible. 
Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. All the studies at great universities and all the ones around the country have shown that no matter what zip code a child comes from, no matter what background, if they go to preschool, not daycare, preschool in school at three, four, and five years old, they increase exponentially, over by over 50% a prospect they’ll go through all 12 years and many beyond. 
And we’ll make sure, sure that low and middle-income… and by the way, the total cost of that… it’s called Title 1 program. We now spend $15 billion for in school districts that don’t have high tax rates. Well, guess what? You change that to 45. You can put every one of these kids in school, pay the teachers legitimate rate and make sure that you have school psychologists and social workers in those schools. We’re going to make sure that for childcare, for someone under the age of five or six, no one ever has to pay more than 7% of their income for their young children to get quality childcare, because you truly want to reward work in this country. We have to ease the financial burden of the care that families are carrying. Even before the pandemic, and many of you know it and many of you are doing it, millions of working families faced enormous financial and personal strains, trying to raise their kids and care for their parents or loved ones living with a disability. 
It’s going to sound strange, when I first got elected, when I was 29 years old to Senate, right after I got elected, my wife and daughter were killed. My two sons survived after hospitalized for a long time. I needed help do my job. I could not possibly afford childcare. Even though I was making a really good salary of $42,000 a year, more than I’d ever made. And I couldn’t afford it. Being a single mom or dad or a family that has two people working with young children, it’s incredibly costly. And by the way, and the professional caregivers out there, home health workers, childcare workers, were more often women, women of color and immigrants, and too often underpaid, unseen and undervalued. That’s why my build back better plan will elevate the compensation, benefits and dignity of caregiver- 
… Back Better Plan will elevate the compensation benefits and dignity of caregivers and workers and early childhood educators. That’s what we’re going to do. It’s also going to invest in education beyond high school. If you qualify to get into community college, you’ll automatically be able to go, and you’ll be able to go for free. If you are qualified to get into a four-year public school in your state public college, and your family makes less than $125, 000 a year, you get to go free. If you’re buying your first home, you’re going to have a tax credit up to $15,000 to get there. What happened after the Great Recession in this one? An awful lot of you range in age from the millennials have started off back after 9/11, all the way to the people graduating this year… Are not in a position to do that, because your jobs have been postponed or non-existent. But providing an opportunity, I can get you into the system. 
We’re also going to protect Social Security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. We’re going to do that all in a partnership and lockstep with the Hispanic community. And by the way, the President’s proposal to eliminate the tax you pay when you get your paycheck for Social Security, without any means by which to replace it, the actuary at social security said Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023. They’ve never liked it to begin with. So look, success and prosperity of the Hispanic Americans is indispensable to the success and prosperity of the United States, and of all America. It’s that simple. Hispanic families are responsible today for $2.6 trillion of our gross domestic product, and growing. If that was a standalone economy, a country all by itself, it would be the eighth largest economy in the world. Think of that. 
Now imagine how much more that would grow if everyone had access to the tools they need to succeed. By investing in Hispanic communities, we’re making the smartest possible investment with the greatest possible returns that our nation could make, period. We also need to rebuild our ability to work with our partners throughout the Western hemisphere to realize the enormous potential of this region in the world, to confront those leaders who continue to oppress the rights of their people. We should be leading the international effort to confront the massive humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. Maduro, who I’ve met, is a dictator, plain and simple, and he’s causing incredible suffering among the Venezuelan people to maintain his grip on power. The Venezuelan people need our support to recover or their democracy and rebuild their country. 
That’s why I would immediately grant temporary protective status to Venezuelans as President. So the Republicans in the Senate can’t keep blocking it like they did again just last week. I’ll make sure we’re supporting neighboring countries that are being overrun with immigration because of Maduro, like Columbia, which are caring for millions of Venezuelans who’ve fled their country in desperation. I’ll use sanctions as one of the tools for a comprehensive strategy that includes humanitarian assistance, international pressure, and support for democratic actors in Venezuela to force the regime to embark on the road to a free and fair election. We also need a new Cuba policy. The administration’s approach is not working. Cuba is no closer to freedom and democracy than it was four years ago. The fact there’s more political prisoners, the secret police are as brutal as ever, and Russia is once again a major presence in Cuba in Havana… For my entire career, I strived for democracy and human rights, for freedom of the press, assembly and religion against dictators of the left and the right. As President, my policy will be governed by two principles. 
First, Americans, especially Cuban-Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. Second, empowering the Cuban people to determine their own future is central to a national security interest in the United States. I think it’s unconscionable that the current administration is deporting hundreds of Cubans back to a dictatorship. There are almost 10,000 Cubans languishing in tent camps along the Mexican border because the administration’s anti-immigration agenda. That’s the administration actively separating Cuban families by not processing visas, through restrictions on family visits and remittances. I think we have to reverse that. The bottom line is that President Trump can not advance the democracy and human rights for the American people when he has embraced so many autocrats around the world, starting with Vladimir Putin. 
Folks, we can do this. We can reach for more as a nation. We can rebuild. We can rebuild the backbone of this country and finally bring everybody along. America’s always done best coming out of crisis. We’re the only nation it’s always come out of every crisis better than we went in. We can build a new administration that reflects the full diversity of our nation, including Hispanic communities. And Hispanic voters, especially in Florida, can help put our nation on a new path forward. And here in Florida today as the deadline to register to vote ends today… If you haven’t registered, go out right now because it is an obligation. Every vote will make a difference. Check and make sure your family and friends are registered, and then make sure everyone has a plan to vote. 
If you can vote by mail, vote by mail. If you can vote in person, vote in person, if you can vote early, vote early. You can vote early in person starting on October 19th in many places in Florida, including right here in Miami. Just make sure you vote. Together we can win. We can’t let this pandemic change everything. We’ve got to get it under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. We can come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat. Proud of it, but I will be an American President, not a democratic President with a capital D. I’ll fight as hard for you and your family whether you vote for me or whether you vote against me because there’s nothing we can’t do when we do it together. 
Folks, I’ve been other more optimistic about our chances as a nation in the 21st century than I’ve been my whole career. There’s not a single solitary thing that’s beyond our capacities as a nation. I mean that sincerely. The most talented workers in the world… We’re the most incredible system in the world. We have a people, who when they stand together, have never, ever, ever, ever failed. Every time I’d walk out of my grandpa’s house up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he’d yell, “Joey, keep the faith.” My grandma, when she was alive, would yell back, “No, Joey, spread it.” Let’s go spread the faith. Take back this country. We’re so much better than this. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you.

43,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-grand-rapids-michigan-speech-transcript-october-2,"Joe Biden Grand Rapids, Michigan Speech Transcript October 2","Hey folks. Good afternoon. Before I start, let me explain the delay. We wanted to make sure that we’re doing everything by the numbers. And so I got two COVID tests this morning, one in Delaware, and one by the former White House doc who came up and everything’s cleared. We want to make sure everything was clear before I came. We were supposed to have an event after this at a headquarters, but based on the crowd size and an indoor, it was concluded by the docs that best not to do it. But I want to thank all of you. I want to thank Matt. And Matt, you’re dead right. You were putting yourself on the line and a lot of other people did all across this country in your union. And I want to thank David way, Secretary-Treasurer of local 951, for having me here today. 
Look, I’d like to start by acknowledging which I sure all of you do as well. Sending my prayers for the health and safety of the first lady and president of the United States after they tested positive for COVID-19. My wife, Jill and I pray that they’ll make a quick and full recovery. This is not a matter of politics. It’s a bracing reminder to all of us that we have to take this virus seriously. It’s not going away automatically. We have to do our part to be responsible. It means following the science, listening to the experts, washing our hands, social distancing. It means wearing a mask in public and means encouraging others to do so as well. It means having masking mandates nationwide. The director of the CDC, Center for Disease Control, Dr. Red field said, and I quote, and he held up a mask. He said, “These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have.” 
Then he held the mask up again and said, “This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than a vaccine.” Leading scientist from the University of Washington tell us that we can save more than 100,000 American lives in the next 100 days alone if everyone wore a mask in public. So let me repeat that because it’s so important. We can save 100,000 lives in the next 100 days, according to the head of the CDC, if everyone wears a mask in public. So be patriotic. It’s not about being a tough guy. It’s about doing your part. Wearing a mask is not only going to protect you, but it also protects those around you. Your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister, husband, wife, neighbor, coworker. Don’t just do it for yourself, do it for the people you love, the people you work with. The seriousness of this virus also underscores that we need regular testing with results turned around rapidly and that’s available to everyone. 
It’s not just the folks in the White House or who travel with me that deserved regular testing, it’s folks in the meatpacking and food processing plants, grocery store workers. Every single American deserves safety and peace of mind. And it means we need transparency. Those who test positive need to participate in contact tracing so that everyone who they may have exposed can get tested themselves. That’s how you stop transmission for any epidemic. Is basic. We need to take the science of fighting this disease seriously if we’re going to save lives. And above all the news is a reminder that we, as a nation, need to do better in dealing with this pandemic. Taking these steps is how we’ll protect ourselves. And just as important is how we will protect one another. Hope that all those who are fighting this virus, including the first family and so many Americans today recover and recover soon. My prayers are with the families of the more than 200. I think it’s seven now. 207,000 Americans who’ve died from this virus. 
Many haven’t got up this morning. The breakfast table with an the empty chair of someone they lost and they loved. We understand. And there’s more than 7 million Americans who are have been infected. That includes folks here in Grand Rapids and all across Michigan, especially all of you or that you have with UFCW who are on the front lines of this pandemic and on the front lines of this economic crisis. UFCW workers who have always been on the front lines of fighting for dignity and respect you deserve. I know it’s been tough. This morning, September jobs report came out. The last one before election day. I’m grateful for all those who were able to get their jobs back to work again, but it was fewer jobs than we had hoped for. Millions of families, millions are still wondering when it will be their turn to come back from the brink. And the signs according to national press are not encouraging. Once again, the pace of job gains is slowing down. Once again, we’re seeing temporary layoffs turn permanent. 
This month marked the largest single month increase in long-term unemployment since we started keeping records in 1948. There are now an additional 781,000 Americans who have been trying to find work for at least six months. They’ve been looking for work for at least six months and haven’t found it. And in the past, that’s a sign for permanency for them. We’re still down 647,000 manufacturing jobs nationwide since the crisis started. All told, we are now 30 million workers who have either lost hours, lost paychecks or lost their jobs entirely. Participating in labor force participation fell last month and remains sharply down since this crisis began, especially for women. There’s another roughly 700,000 people who have dropped out of the labor force. Stopped looking for a job. The vast majority were women demonstrating once again how this economic crisis has been especially tough on women and families in This country. This will be the first presidency in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when it came into office. 
Michigan has lost more than then 361,000 jobs since the beginning of 2017. In fact, factories were already closing before COVID like the Knoll plant here in Grand Rapids. They announced back in January, they were shutting down and cutting 210 local jobs. Manufacturing has already slipped into recession last year. The net loss of auto manufacturing jobs you saw here in Michigan. And that economic pain was only amplified by the pandemic. Your schools and local businesses are closed like all places around America. More than 26 million unemployment claims were filed by Americans last month. 46 million Americans have exhausted their emergency savings and essential workers here in Grand Rapids won’t forget how the UFCW members saw their jobs turned suddenly into a life and death task. Folks, today’s report reinforces another painful trend. A continuing of what economists call a K-shaped recovery. And K means that letter going up. That’s those who on the top, it keeps going up while everyone else in the middle is going down and below. We’re seeing things get worse. 
It means essential workers, UFCW workers who sacrificed to keep us going through the pandemic and continuing are being left behind by the most unequal recovery in modern history. Because while workers are struggling, this is a fact, the top 100 billionaires in America have done pretty well. Just the top 100 of them. They’ve made up more than $30 billion this year in the last nine months. And everyone else, though you keep hoping, you get the bottom of that K-shaped recovery. You get the downward slide. You’re left to figure out how you’re going to pay the bills and put food on the table. How to balance doing your job with being a teacher to your kids because their school has gotten remote. You’re asked to risk your neck because you can’t work from home when the risks for COVID are kept outside because you work at a meat packing plant or an assembly line or the checkout counter. I do understand this is a scary time, an uncertain time. 
I understand it and I see you because I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania. A lot like Grand Rapids. It’s filled with an awful lot of good people busting their neck every day, do the right thing for their families. In Scranton my mom used to have an expression. She said not just in Scranton, but from the time we left there. She said, “Joey, nobody’s better than you Joey, but everybody’s your equal.” My dad’s constant refrain after he lost a job in Scranton when there were no more work and he had to move to Delaware. He moved away for a little over a year and come back every weekend to see us. The time we finally, a couple years down the road in Delaware, got to finally be able to buy a home. My dad used to use this expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” These are the values that shaped my growing up and I suspect most you. 
It shaped my whole life. So I know and understood from the very beginning of consciousness about this, that Wall Street and CEOs didn’t build this country, the middle-class built this country and unions built the middle class. That’s why I’ve laid out a comprehensive agenda, not just to rebuild our communities, but to make bold investments so we can build back and bill back better. And independent analysis actually from Wall Street, Moody’s, projected that my plan will create 18.6 million jobs. 7 million more than the administration’s economic plan and $1 trillion more in economics growth than the president’s plan. That’s not coming from a liberal think tank, that’s coming from Moody’s. Here’s how my plan works. I’m going to raise taxes on people only making over 400. Anyone making less than $400,000 a year won’t pay a penny more. But I’m going to ask the very big corporations, the Fortune 500 and the wealthy to pay their fair share for a change. That means raising the corporate tax rate, which was in the mid 30s and now is 21% back to 28%. 
That means making sure that no big company gets away with paying zero taxes as 91 Fortune 500 companies do today making billions of dollars. Zero taxes. How many of you pay zero taxes? Means making sure the wealthiest Americans don’t get to pay at a lower tax rate because they’re making money on their investments, but they pay at the same rate that they pay for their salary. These changes in the tax code will raise the money, it’ll allow me to invest in working people and growing the middle class. Which is when I announced I was running, I said, that’s the reason. To rebuild the backbone of this country. Hardworking folks in the middle class, we’re going to invest in creating millions of good paying jobs, union jobs. By the way, my plan has been thoroughly analyzed by a whole bunch of folks. Take infrastructure, building roads, bridges, highways, ports, airports will put millions of people to work in good paying union jobs and create the foundation for growth in this country. 
Clean energy. Just upgrading 4 million buildings and weatherizing 2 million homes will create at least 1 million good paying jobs. Leading in the world on electric vehicles and building 500,000 electric charging stations on our highways will create 1 million new auto jobs here in this state. The manufacturing and technology in those areas, making sure the future is made in America, made in Michigan with good union jobs. The federal government spends $600 billion a year of your tax dollars. 600 billion a year to purchase everything from military equipment to steel, to cars, to trucks, to federal fleets at $600 billion. When I’m president, we’re going to make sure we finally make good on a commitment made a long time ago that these products, all these contracts, that the president of United States and the federal government can award, make sure those products are made by Americans in America. Making sure that, that’s done. 
It’s estimated that we’ll create 5 million new manufacturing jobs and technology jobs. For small businesses, we’re going to make sure small businesses come out on the other side of this terrible circumstance with access to capital and the ability to deal with the debts that have been accumulated during this pandemic. And we’ll make investments to increase incomes as well. $15 minimum wage. No one should be in a position to have to work two jobs just to get above the poverty line. We’re going to bring back jobs from overseas to America and direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help communities like those in Western Michigan compete for new business startups. For our essential workers, we’re not just going to praise you, we’re going to pay you a good wage to ensure you have a strong benefits. 
We’re going to ease the burden of the major cost in your life. Healthcare. We’ll build on the Affordable Care Act through a new health insurance option, a not-for-profit public option which will give private insurers a real competitor. We’ll increase subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower. So you can afford the plans with lower deductions and lower out-of-pocket expenses. That plan alone will cost over $700 billion over 10 years, but it’s paid for by eliminating those tax cuts. For a 40 year old making $50,000 a year, your monthly premium will go down by a third. We’ll take on the pharmaceutical companies with a plan that slashes the cost of prescription drugs for up to 60%. Medicare will be able to negotiate prices for drugs fundamentally lowering those prices. And childcare. A lot of you’re dealing with that now. How do you go to work if you have work and take care of your kids or an aging relative that’s in trouble? 
We’re going to make high quality childcare affordable and accessible. Every three and four year old will have access to free quality preschool. We’re going to make sure that low and middle-income families will never have to pay more than 7% of their income for caring for a young child. In education beyond high school. We’re going to make sure that four year college tuition of a state university is tuition free for any family making less than $125,000. Community college would be free and programs and training will be free as well. If you buying your first home, you’ll have a $15,000 help to get there. These are all things that people have been talking about for a while. We’re going to protect social security, increase the benefits for millions of seniors. 
The president’s talking about eliminating the withholding tax. Well, that’s wonderful except for one thing, the actuary of social security said if that plan goes through social security will be bankrupt by 2023. Folks, I promise you, we can do this. Let me close by saying this. I know a lot of people around here are tired of feeling overlooked and disrespected. I get that. The people I met this week taking a train through Northeastern, Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. People like the dedicated elementary school teacher from Lordstown, Ohio, whose husband, when Lordstown shut down accepted a transfer to Kentucky eight hours away each direction in order to be able to keep his healthcare and his pension after the GM plant closed. Folks who worry about healthcare. Will the Affordable Care Act still be there for them? Why? Why they ask. Will I be among the 100 million Americans who could lose the protections for pre-existing conditions like asthma and diabetes? 
Where once again, women will be able to charge a higher premium just simply because they’re a woman. Where insurers no longer have to allow you to be able to keep your kids on a healthcare plan until age 26. What will happen to your Medicare benefits, your social security? Will they still be there when you retire? I’m asked many times in recent years, how do we get to the place where people who stock our shelves, pack our food, teach our kids like my family, take care of my wife, take care of our sick, who race into burning buildings and pick up the garbage off our streets. Who did. How do we get to the place where you all don’t think we see you anymore or hear them and most importantly, respect them? That has to change. I know it can. I come from those neighborhoods. We can get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again for everyone. But this cannot be a partisan moment, it must be an American moment. 
We have to come together as a nation. I’m running as a Democrat, but I will run and govern as an American president. Whether you voted for me or against me, I will represent you. And those who see each other as fellow Americans who just don’t live in red states or blue states, but who live in and love the United States of America. That’s who we are. And there’s never been a single solitary thing America’s been unable to do. Think of this. Not once. Not a single thing we’ve not been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. So let’s get the heck up. Remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity. I want to say, God bless you and God protect the first family and every family who’s dealing with this virus and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
44,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-train-tour-campaign-speech-transcript-johnstown-pa-september-30-night-after-debate,"Joe Biden Train Tour Campaign Speech Transcript Johnstown, PA September 30: Night After Debate","Love Johnstown. It’s good to be back. It’s good to be back. Well, thank you. I tell you what, I first came to Johnstown and it was all Democrat. And guess what? Johnstown and this county’s going to be Democrat again after this election. [crosstalk 00:07:38] It’s good to be back, man. I’ll tell you what. It’s been an incredible day. We started this morning in Cleveland, Ohio, where just last night I had a truly unique experience of debating whatever his name was, Donald Trump. 
Oh, man. 
And from there, we’ve been to communities all across Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. We’re finishing up right here in Johnstown tonight. I want to thank the lieutenant governor, for being here. We call lieutenant governor’s wife [inaudible 00:08:20] governor. So, governor, thanks for being here and thank your wife as well and all the local elected officials and leaders for joining us today. And, Brian, thank you for your years of service and your wife’s service to our country, the United States Navy, and for sharing your stories with us. Last night, the President of the United States was reminded that he said that our veterans were losers and suckers. 
No, I’m serious about this. Like your family, my son spent a year in Iraq. It’s about ready. That’s a good thing. It’s still running. That’s a good thing. But wait, he came back decorated with the Bronze Star and the Conspicuous Service Medal. I thought it was despicable, that Donald Trump referred to everyone, from my friend and colleague and my competitor, John McCain, straight through to my son and others. It’s despicable. The man doesn’t deserve to be Commander in Chief of the world’s best military. But I want to thank the good people at Amtrak, who’ve been keeping me moving today. Quite frankly, my whole career. I started by taking the train, when I got elected as a 29 year old kid, to the United States Senate. 
I started going back and forth every single day, so I could be home in Wilmington every night with two young boys as a single dad after I lost my wife. Two hours each way, nearly 250 miles every day, so I could be there for breakfast with the boys. It wasn’t Ozzie and Harriet stuff, it was just sort of cornflakes. But at least I got to be there to play with my daughter, kiss them good morning, go home and kiss them goodnight. That train brought me back to my home base every single night, to my family. It kept me grounded. It kept me connected. It meant I always remembered what and who really mattered in my life. And riding that train all those miles every day, and I spent as the conductors informed me, over 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. 
They said, “Biden, they named a station after you.” They should have named the whole damn road after me all those times. All kidding aside. But seriously, it’s a true story. I’d ride home at night after a debate with the United States Senate, about a fair tax policy, or about healthcare, or about unions that I was fighting for. And I look out… I really mean this. I look out like I did coming from Cleveland today. I look out at all those home I pass, those middle class neighborhoods like I was raised in. I was raised in, like a lot of you I expect, a three bedroom… 
I was raised, like a lot of you I expect, in a three-bedroom home, split level house, four kids, mom, dad and a grandpop living with us. I tell you what, I wonder if you’re having the same conversation that my mom and dad had when we were growing up, sitting there, wondering, “Honey, we need four new tires on the car. We can’t afford it. We’ve got to wait another couple months before we can get them.” Who’s going tell them, we might not have the money to help them go back to the university this semester? Who’s going to say it? Maybe we’re going to have to worry about whether or not they’re turning the electricity off because we’re behind on our bill because of job change, or I lost my health insurance. 
Those are conversations that people are having today. The fact of the matter is, the vast majority of people in the middle class, over 50% said if they got a bill for $400 and it was unexpected in one month, that they could either borrow money or sell something to pay it. I think about their struggles and their words. I think about their hopes and their dreams. I talked to the other passengers on the train, and I got pretty friendly with some of the conductors. I learned about their lives and their families. It was a constant reminder that every single person has their own unique story, their own journey. In my experience, everyone is just looking for a chance. It’s not a guarantee. It’s a chance to get ahead, just a fair shot, an equal opportunity to pursue their dreams. 
That dream gets further and further out of reach for so many folks here in Johnstown, my hometown of Scranton, Claymont where I was raised. It’s getting harder and harder. That’s what I’ve seen today at every stop on that train, from the folks who join me on this trip. I’ve spent time with a dedicated school elementary teacher from Lawrencetown, Ohio, who spoke about how the GM Plant … Remember, the President said, “Don’t sell your homes. Everything’s going to be okay in Lawrencetown. Everything’s going to stay.” That GM plant closed and guess what? It devastated the whole community. About how her own husband had to accept a transfer to a plant in Kentucky, an eighth-hour drive each way, only home on the weekends, just in order to maintain his healthcare and his pension. Now, he drives 16 hours every weekend, just to see her and the kids. 
I listened to an incredible young woman, a mother of four at home, a heath aide and a nursing student. Talk about how worried she is that no one is looking out for the caregivers in this country, the people who, so many of them have literally risked and given their lives so that we’d be okay, especially during this pandemic. I saw steel workers and iron workers whose union brothers and sisters built Pittsburgh’s famous bridges, proud operating engineers who keep the engines of our economy pumping. I heard from union members who’ve gotten a raw deal so many times and so many more at every stop that I made, just hard working people like all of you, folks who played by the rules and paid their fair share their whole lives, folks who never asked for a single thing to be given to them, just a chance to earn it. 
Folks, it couldn’t be a more stark difference from what I saw last night on that debate stage, a self-entitled, self-serving President who thinks everything is about him. He thinks that, if he just yells louder and louder, throws out lie after lie after lie, he’ll get his way. He thinks you’ll forget. Well, he picked the wrong guy. I don’t forget. I don’t forget that in February, he’s on tape acknowledging he knew how serious this pandemic was. He knew how quickly it would spread, that thousands of people would be killed, but he forgot to say a single thing. He kept it secret. He was more worried about the stock market collapsing than about the over 205,000 people who’ve died. 
He didn’t say a word. What did he tell us? He said it’d be gone by Easter. It will go away in the warm weather. He told us it will just go away like a miracle, and then maybe if we injected bleach in our arm, we may be okay. He thinks we’ll forget about how badly he mismanaged this pandemic that cost us more so far than 205,000 lives and counting, almost 30 million people on unemployment insurance. He thinks we’ll forget the reason our businesses and our schools are closed is because he took no responsibility. He’s a complete failure. He didn’t get the people the PPE, the resources they need to be able to reopen safely. He didn’t speak to you or the American people about the concerns. Not even once last night did he say a word about anything. 
Seriously, think about it. Not once, because not only the trail of broken promises, lies he told communities like Johnstown and all across the industrial Midwest, it’s more than that. Just as I said last night, when he heard that 1,000 people a day were dying, what was his comment? He said, “It is what it is.” That’s because he is who he is. Then, when he ran, he told us how much he cared about people like my family and yours, the places we come from. His staff reported him saying, this is about three weeks ago, the truth is, he said that he in fact, thinks that we’re all losers. He doesn’t respect. No, behind closed doors, it’s been reported that he called his own supporters, working class folks that the Democrats along the way began to forget about, what he called them, his supporters, quote, “Disgusting.” 
He’s the same guy who lets you earn a couple bucks parking cars at his country club, but even if you had the money, he wouldn’t allow you to join. They look down the nose at working families trying to do it right. It’s been confirmed by multiple sources that he thinks that those of us who signed up and put our country, put our lives on the line, our veterans, as I mentioned earlier, are just suckers and losers. I mean this from the bottom of my heart. It’s absolutely despicable. I’ll tell you. By the way, six of his generals, who work for him, all say he’s not worthy of being President of the United States of America, his own generals. 
I’ll tell you right now, that’s not how I was raised. It’s not how you were raised. It’s not how the vast majority of Americans who break their neck every day just wanting to get a fair shake were raised. By the way, Donald Trump can only see the world from Park Avenue. He cares only what the super rich and connected thinks. He only sees value in stock portfolios. I don’t own a single share of stock. I have the dubious distinction, when I got elected … Maybe that’s why he doesn’t like me very much. I’ve been listed as the poorest man in Congress for 36 years. You think I’m joking? I’m not proud of it. It’s true. I think you’re supposed to earn money while you’re in politics. 
In addition to that, when I got elected to the Vice Presidency, the headline in the paper saying it’s probable no man has ever assumed the office of the Vice President with few assets than Joe Biden. I don’t think they were speaking intellectually. Guess what? His only metric is how the economy is doing, his Dow Jones. It doesn’t matter if communities like Johnstown are still hurting, and he doesn’t have a plan to help you or get back on your feet or deliver relief to the people who most need help. He’s too busy planning for his next big tax giveaway. It’s a true story. Billionaires made $300 billion more in this pandemic, fact, and now you know what his new tax plan is? He’s proposing another $30 billion tax cut for billionaires by reducing what they call capital gains to 15%. They’ll be making billions and paying a lower rate than a firefighter, a school teacher, a school teacher and a firefighter together, a lower rate. The 100 richest folks in this country, are in fact, own more wealth than about half the population. It’s time, when nearly 30 million people are on unemployment, 100 million people, he’s trying to take away your healthcare. 100 million people with pre-existing conditions, he’s going to court a week after the election to try to eliminate the Affordable Care Act. 
By the way, if this, if I tried, if we made a movie about this, they’d think it’s just all fiction. It couldn’t be possible. In the middle of this pandemic, when you have seven million people infected, 40,000- 
… million people infected. 40,000 a day becoming infected. 750 to 1000 a day dying. And his one goal is to take away healthcare. Not a joke, not a joke. 10 million people have already lost the healthcare provided by their employers because their employers have gone out of business. 10 million, and 20 million people, if he gets his way, and I think it’s on November 7th, 8th, 9th, or 10th, I go to the Supreme Court. 
They’ll lose, 20 million people will lose their health insurance. 
More than a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions will in fact be charged more for their coverage. What’s going to happen is, in addition to that, when they eliminate the Affordable Care Act, we’re going to be able to charge women more money running from the same procedures men getting charged for. Not a joke. And that’s what the law he wants to eliminate will do. Pregnancy will become again, not a joke, a pre-existing condition that you can charge a great deal more for. Folks, we can’t let that happen. He’s too busy trying to salvage his foundering re-election campaign to understand that people don’t want a superficial temporary tax cut on their withholding tax because [inaudible 00:25:42] take it out of social security. You know what the social security actuary said? “If this plane goes through, social security will be totally bankrupt by 2023.” 
I know this sounds ridiculous. Remember I told you, Paul Ryan was there. They wanted to cut Medicaid and cut social security. That was in their budget. That’s what they want to do. I don’t know where these guys come from. Look, I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life, guys who look down on us because they got them out of money, inherited it, guys who think they’re better than you, guys, who, as I said, might let you park the car at a country club they own but never let you join or come in, guys who inherited everything you’ve ever gotten and then squandered it. I see the world from where I grew up in Scranton. Not a joke. You see it from a different perspective of Johnstown or any time we stopped in today. It’s filled with people who are busting their necks to do right by their families every day. They aren’t worried about the stock market. They’re worried about putting food on the table every night. They’re worried about making the rent. 20 million people are worried they won’t be able to pay their mortgage payment this month. 20 million. 
My mom used to always say, Jean Finnegan Biden from Scranton, she said, “Joey, remember, look at me, Joey, nobody is better than you, but everyone is your equal.” He doesn’t get that. When my dad had to leave Scranton when there were no jobs and we moved to Wilmington, he didn’t have to commute like the woman I met today, her husband, eight hours each way, but he had to commute back and forth to Wilmington every weekend and that was only a three and a half hour drive each way. But when we got to Delaware and finally were able to buy a house three years later, my dad used to day, “Joe, the job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” That’s what was missing today. Providing dignity to the work do we. 
Those are the values that shaped my life, and when it gets down to it, I think this whole campaign gets down to Park Avenue versus Scranton. Park Avenue versus Johnstown. Trump may think there ought to be a different set of rules for him and his rich buddies, rules that get them out of taxes, get them out of responsibilities, get them out of consequences for every one of the mistakes they make. But I don’t think so. I think it’s about time to start rewarding work and not wealth. And I think it’s about time that families get a break and the super wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share. We’re still going to do well, even if they pay their fair share. But here’s what I know. Donald Trump will never understand. Wall Street didn’t build this country, CEOs didn’t. The middle class built America and unions built the middle class. 
That’s why my plan is about helping communities like Johnstown and Scranton and Claymont, places I grew up, to build that better. I’m here today to say to you, I’ll do as President what Donald Trump hasn’t. I’ll fight for you. Not for the corporations. You, your jobs, your family. Now we’re going to build back better. It’s all about injecting life and capital back into places like Johnstown. It starts with a simple proposition. Buy American. The federal government spends $600 billion of your taxpayer’s money every single year on everything from military equipment to steel railings to buildings to highways, cars and trucks in federal fleets. While I’m President, we’re going to make sure that every one of those products, every single piece that goes into any of those contracts is made and built in America. I’m serious. We can do this. [inaudible 00:30:24] send jobs overseas. Any company in my administration that off shores jobs will pay a 10% penalty, and any company that brings jobs back or reopens the closed factories like those around Johnstown will get a 10% credit and an incentive to build back. 
We’re going to direct billions of dollars in revitalization funds and competitive grants to help places like Johnstown compete for new businesses and startups. We’re going to make four years of public education, two years of community college free for families making less than under 25 grand. We’re going to lower healthcare costs by increasing subsidies for your premiums so they’re lower, slashing the cost of prescription drugs by literally as much as 60%. And you say, “How do you do that, Joe?” Well, we’re going to do a system that sets up an expert panel of 25 people for every new drug that comes on the market. You have to go before that group of experts, they’ll set the price based on your investment, just like you do for your utility, and you cannot raise that price ever again beyond the cost of medical inflation. 
We’re going to take on the opioid crisis [inaudible 00:31:47] effective treatment, and for substance use disorders. We’re going to do it all without raising a penny in taxes for anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year. If you make more than $400,000, I’m going to raise your taxes. So raise your hand. No, maybe you didn’t believe me that I could do that without raising taxes on the middle class. But hat’s before you found out that the billionaire Donald Trump only paid $750 in income taxes. If Trump’s Park Avenue pals start paying their fair share we’ll have more than enough money to finally build an economy that works for everybody. So I promise you this. I see you. I hear you. I respect you. I grew up with you. And the families of those more than 200,000 Americans that have died in this pandemic will be heard and respected by me. 
I’ll work like crazy to get this pandemic under control so we can get our economy working again, for everyone to get back our lives. We’re a nation in incredible pain right now. So many empty chairs around the dining table at night because somebody’s been lost to the family. So many businesses closed, doors closed forever because the money that the Congress voted to get to small businesses went to his friends, his rich friends on Wall Street. So many proud people on unemployment for the first time in their lives, not able to get the kind of unemployment insurance that we initially passed in Congress. As my wife said, “This is not a partisan moment. This is an American moment.” No, I really mean it. We can’t afford to go on being divided. We can’t afford to have a leader who does nothing but throw gasoline on the anger and hatred that’s burning in this country. 
We have to come together. Look, I promise you all this. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I will be an American President. [crosstalk 00:34:05] for those who support me as those who did not, I promise you this, I’ll fight for you. That’s what we need right now, a President who will try to bring us together, who will speak to what is best in all of us, rather than trying to divide us. Put that dog whistle out, and racism. Did you hear that he said last night? When he was asked by the Fox commentator, asked would he condemn White supremacy, which the FBI says is a serious threat to terrorism in America today, he said, “Well, of course, I’m against all bad news.” I said, “How about the Proud Boys?” “The Proud Boys,” he said, “Well, I’ll tell you what. Just tell them to stand down but stand by.” Go online. The Proud Boys now have a logo saying, “Stand down but stand by.” 
And they said in the newspaper today that [inaudible 00:35:18] was Vladimir Putin. Not a joke. In fact, threaten that if he doesn’t win, there’ll be violence. Look, we’ve got to stop pitting ourselves against one another. We’re one people. We’re one nation, one America. We need to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. In our long history, there’s been nothing, nothing ever, think about this. In every crisis we’ve ever had, there’s not going to single thing we’ve been unable to overcome, nothing, when we act together, and we’ve done it together. 
… when we act together, we’ve done it together. Folks, I am so optimistic about what the country is ready to do. No, no, I really am. I think we’re ready to stand up, I think the blinders have been taken off the American people. They understand what’s at stake. We can own the 21st century. We are, as Madeleine Albright said, ” The essential country.” We can and must lead the world again. We’ve not only led the world by the example of our power, but the power of our example. 
Why does the rest of the whole follower us? Because of who we are, what we stand for, our example, and it’s being trashed all over the world. There was a recent Pew poll done in the major nations of the world, Donald Trump as president, this is not a joke. Check it online. Donald Trump is less respected than President Xi and Putin. Can you imagine that? So folks, look, as I said, this United States of America, we can do anything, and we’re about to do it. With your help, the grace of God and the goodwill of our neighbors, as my grandpa would say, “We’re coming back.” So God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. We are coming back this year. 30 something days. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you."

Hello everybody. It’s great to be here. I just want the record to show that Jim promised, if I get elected president of United States, I can go down to the Houston facility and work and try to drive any this machinery I get a shot at. I used to have a license to drive tractor trailers, but I tell you what, I’m looking at that sucker, that big Caterpillar. That’s a good one. But I’m not sure I want to try that crane, man, that looks awful. That looks awful tough. I know. Well, I’ll tell you what, it’s great to be here. 
There was an old expression when I was growing up in Scranton, you go home with them that brung you to the dance. And labor brought me to the dance a long, long time ago. They’re the ones who are the operating engineers and the carpenters. Early on, first time that I ran, people who laid the tracks and the pipelines, who operate the cranes and shape the skyline, who build the foundations of everything we rely on. Labor as I said, brought me to the dance, not an exaggeration. And the only reason I’m standing here today as a candidate for president, if it hadn’t been for labor back in 1972, when I was a 29 year old kid, just after Labor Day, I was losing the election. I think it was 54 to 19 going into the election. And then labor came on board. Carpenters across the board, just up and down, operating engineers, the steel workers and we ended up winning by an overwhelming margin of 3,200 votes statewide when Nixon won the state was 68% of the vote. I don’t forget. 
My dad used to have an expression for real. He said, “The only way to deal with the abuse of power, Joey, is with power. And the only people can take on major corporate interests and the oligarchs who are abusing power, the working men and women are organized labor.” That’s not an exaggeration. The only ones. The only ones. And that’s why I’ve been so supportive of labor my whole career. I’ve never forgotten everything that they’ve done for me, you’ve done for me, but not just for me, but for the country. You are literally not figuratively, the backbone of America. The military is the spine of America, you’re the backbone of America. An awful lot of you served in the military as well. You’re the ones who actually built this country, not Wall Street bankers and CEOs. You built the country and you’re going to build it and you’re going to build it back better than it was before. 
And I want thank Jim. I want to thank President Callahan and his team as well as the folks in Local 66 for welcoming me here today and giving us an inside look at everything you’re doing to rebuild and energize Western Pennsylvania. I’m from Eastern Pennsylvania. I’m from up in Lackawanna County in that valley and a lot’s going to happen here. I am so confident. I really am that we’re not only coming back, we’re going to come back big. I mean hardworking folks. I want to thank Vice President Frank Spencer and the carpenters for all they do as well. I’m honored, the trust you’ve placed in me and I want to thank you a lot for it. And if I have the honor of becoming president, I’ll be fighting for you every single day. And I promise you, hear me now, you will have a seat at the table at the White House. No fundamental decisions will be made without you sitting in literally not figuratively. Literally, that’s a word. You have my word on it. 
And folks, I’ve been on a train today. I’ve traveled, it’s kind of like going back home. I traveled over 2,100,000 miles over 40 years on Amtrak going back and forth every single solitary night to see my kids. A 250 mile round trip. But we came today, we on an Amtrak train, do a whistle stop tour. We started off in Cleveland, across Ohio, into Western Pennsylvania. And riding the rails reminds me of when I would take the train home from Wilmington to Washington and back every night. And I used to go back when you get through round the beltway, going into Baltimore, you go through a number of middle class neighborhoods like houses like I grew up in. Three bedroom split level homes, that kind of thing. 
And I used to literally, when we’d have debates on the floor of the Senate, look out that window and I’d sit there and I’d see the lights on and the homes we were passing just like we saw coming from Cleveland into Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh to here. And I’d wonder, do they have the same kind of conversations at that table that my mom and dad had at our table? Are they having the same kind of conversations the guys I grew up with, the women I grew up with had? No honey, we can’t get four new tires on the car. We can’t afford it, we got to wait another month. Literally not figuratively, literally. Or, I know we need a new hot water heater. We can’t afford it. We got to wait. It’s going to take a little while longer. 
You have vast majority of the middle class saying before we got into this recession. If they got an unexpected bill for $400 in a month that they didn’t expect, they’d either have to borrow the money or put it off. They’re neighbors I grew up in. You’re the only ones that saved them from people from having to do that if in fact you’re able to have work. Folks, I knew all those families inside and those families and on that route today. I didn’t know their names, but I know what’s on their minds. What their concerns were. They’re not looking for a handout, all they’re looking for is a hand up. My dad used to say, “Joe, I don’t expect the government to solve my problems, but I sure in heck expect them to understand my problem.” We’re not understanding the problems of the vast majority of Americans today. All they’re looking for as a fair shot and a little bit of dignity and a little bit of respect instead of being looked down on so that the parents could look their kids in the eye and say, “Honey, everything’s going to be okay.” 
My dad used to have that expression. After we left Scranton, he had to move to Delaware and commute every day for over a year and finally be able to get us down. Not every day, once a week, come back every week. And finally, we got apartment in Claymont Delaware. A little steel town, has no more steel now. And then we finally ever got a home four years later. But it’s what a lot of people we’re still going through. There’s a stark difference from what I saw last night on the debate stage. An entitled self serving president who inherited everything in his life and squandered it. A president who calls his own supporters, according to some staff members, his own supporters, disgusting. Who thinks that folks who put their lives on the line for our country in the military are losers and suckers. It’s despicable. 
I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life. The guys who might let you park the cars at their country club, pick up a few bucks but even if you had the money, wouldn’t let you join the country club because of your religion or because of your background. Guys who stiff contractors, building their hotels and their golf courses, just to put a few more bucks in their pocket, seems to take some joy in it. Guys who think the rules don’t apply to them. Guys and make tens of millions of dollars and pay $750 in federal taxes in a year. 
Donald Trump sees things from Park Avenue. I see him from where I grew up in Scranton and Claymont. My mom, Jean Finnegan Biden had a backbone like a ramrod, all five foot one of her. And my mom used to have an expression. I really mean it. I used to be a stutter and it’s when you’re a stutter you’re used to bullies. It’s easy to make fun of somebody who talks like that. That’s how I learned to fight. Joke used to be, Biden’s like shoe leather. You can beat him, but he’s going to hurt you. You have to stand up to these folks. Well, my mom would say, “Joey, look at me, look at me. Remember, nobody is better than you, nobody, but everybody’s your equal.” And she meant it. She meant it. As I said, my dad’s expression when we moved to Delaware was he’d talk about how a job is a lot more than about a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. 
Those values shaped my whole life. If you look back on my career, you notice it shaped my whole career, my Build Back Better plan. It shaped my views as president what I’ll do. It’s all about giving communities like Greensburg and New Alexandra and Claymont and Scranton and places in parts of Cleveland I just came out of, giving women and men who work on pipelines and construction sites a fair shot. We’re going to invest $2 trillion in infrastructure, including more than 50 billion in one year to get to repairing our schools, our highways, our bridges, revitalizing our locks and our dams, making our inland waterways the finest in the world. That’s what attracts businesses. That’s what brings employment. You talk about how much my plan costs. Well, guess what? Those investments are going to create millions of high paying jobs. Building a modern infrastructure and a durable energy future. And I promise you this, in my administration, collective bargaining, now hear me, collective bargaining will be sacred. It’s a guarantee. A guarantee. And union apprenticeships, union apprenticeships will be sacred. Last thing we need is corporate America taking over apprenticeships programs like they tried to do. 
We’re going to stand up for prevailing wage and benefit productions and the Davis Bacon Act. I guarantee. You may recall the president, he used to like to surprise me at State of the Union addresses says, “And Sheriff Joe will take care of the Build Back.” we didn’t call it Build Back Better, it was Recovery Act $800 billion. Not a single project was not prevailing wage. It’s a guarantee, every single solitary project we built. And so folks, we’re going to level the playing field for you and for your families. We’re going to have wages and benefits. We’re going to lower healthcare cost, prescription drug prices. We’re going to take on the opioid crisis for real, with effective treatment. Making four years of public college universities, apprentice programs, tuition free, anybody making less than $125,000 a year if they go to a state university, they go to a community college it’s automatic. If they’re in an apprentice program, it’s going to be free. 
My wife has an expression. She’s a community college professor, “Any country that out educates us will out compete us.” The cost is staggering for people having to carry the burden. And we’re going to do it without asking anyone who makes under $400,000 a year to pay one more penny in taxes, guaranteed, my word on it, because what we’re going to do, we’re going to get rid of the God awful $2 trillion tax cut that Trump passed. 1.4 trillion of it going to the top 1%, a significant portion of that going to the top 1/10th of 1%. We’re going to start rewarding work, not wealth. We’re going to make sure corporations began to pay. The Fortune 500 companies, 91 don’t pay a single penny in taxes and some of them make multi-billion dollars. How about your taxes? You pay nothing in taxes? 
We’re not going to punish anybody, everybody’s going to pay their fair share. Look, a lot of people around here voted for Donald Trump last time. I get it. I understand why. I’ve been asked many times in recent years, “How do we get to a place where the people who teach our kids, take care of our sick, build our bridges, operate our cranes, who race into burning buildings and don’t ask who’s in the other end there, whether you’re black or white or Muslim or Christian, people who in fact grow our food, how do we get to a place where they don’t think we don’t see them? Or hear them? Or respect them?” Well, I see them. I hear them. I respect them. I know them. They’re family and it’s going to change. It’s going to change with me. Look, this is not a partisan moment. This is an American moment. And I mean that seriously. Think about it. 
We have a chance to put the anger and division that has overtaken this country behind us. We can be what we are at our best. One people, one America. We just need to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. Think about this. Never once in our history, when we’ve set our mind to it, have we not been able to accomplish whatever we set our mind to do when we’ve done it together. There’s not a single thing we can’t do. And with your help, I’m going to get elected. And with us working together, I promise you. I promise you, it’s going to be a different America. We again, reward work not just wealth. Where people are treated with decency. 
I’ll conclude by saying, a president’s words matter, no matter how good or bad a president is, the words they utter matter and can take us to war. They can bring peace, they can make the market rise or fall, they can change people’s lives. And this president has breathed hate and division under the rocks here. Hate only hides. It doesn’t go away. And it matters what presidents say. And you heard what he said last night, when he was asked by the moderator, “Will you condemn white supremacy?” And he fuddled around didn’t say anything. I said, “How about the Proud Boys?” And he said, “Well,” the context he likes he said, “just tell them to stand down and stand by.” Go online. Look up Proud Boys they’ve got a new emblem now, literally. It says, “Stand down and stand by.” Implying that if he loses the election, something may have to be done. I promise you that won’t happen. The American people are going to speak. They’re going to speak in large numbers and nobody is going to get in the way of our democratic process going forward. Nobody, period. 
This is the United States of America. We’re not as some tin horn, dictator shepherded, third world country. This is the United States of America. I want to thank you all for your endorsements. I really mean it. Means a lot to me personally, just on a personal level I appreciate it. God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you so very much."
46,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-train-tour-campaign-speech-transcript-alliance-ohio-september-30,"Joe Biden Train Tour Campaign Speech Transcript Alliance, Ohio September 30","… I just want you to know that I appreciate the opportunity to be here and appreciate the opportunity to move on. Alliance started as a place where people came together and it’s what we so badly need to do now in this country, is begin, again, to come together. We rode today with some remarkable Ohioans and whose families are here, Tiffany Davis and her husband, Tom, and her kids and Jacqueline, [Komar 00:00:25] and her husband, William, and their daughter and grandson, and [Dave Worshack 00:00:35] and his wife, Kathy, and their children. 
It was an honor to get a chance to meet them and to spend a little time talking about their circumstances. How Tom who worked online at Lordstown is now making that eight hour drive to Kentucky so he can keep a job and make a living, and Jacqueline who taught high school math at Maple Heights for years, and now worries, what’s going to happen to William if they lose the protections that are available through Obamacare for preexisting conditions? And Dave who’s fighting like hell for his coworkers after management announced the Akron plant was going to close this year. Like millions of hardworking Americans, they’re not looking for a handout, they’re just looking for a fair shot to be seen, to be understood, to be heard. 
They remind me of my dad. I was from another Valley, a little further East, the Lackawanna Valley, Scranton, Pennsylvania. My dad had a job in Scranton and when coal died and everything started to close up, we ended up in a circumstance where my dad did what you’re doing old buddy, only he didn’t have to do it for eight hours, what made that, what I called the longest walk a parent ever has to make, up a short flight of stairs and say, “Honey, I’m not going to be home during the week. I’m going to have to move down, in this case, to Delaware.” 
That was only about a three and a half hour ride at that time, not an eight hour ride. He did that for well over a year, and finally was able to get us to … We had to move. There was no work. My dad, it just reminds me of what he used to always say, and I apologize the press hearing me say this many times, but it’s a fact and it’s relevant. My dad used to say in Wilmington, Delaware, when we finally were able to purchase a home, move on an apartment and get going again. My dad would say, “Joe remember, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to hold your head up. Be able to look at your kid and say, “Honey, it’s going to be okay.”” “Well, the fact is I don’t expect the government to solve my problem,” he’d say, “But I do expect them to at least understand the problem.” 
That’s what last night’s debate was about, this whole election is about, does your president have any idea and understand what you’re going through? And if he does, does he care about it? Is he able, as my mom would say, be able to walk a mile and your shoes, if you wanted to know me, they’re able to do that? Or does he just ignore you, look down on you, lie to you, like this president did when he told Ohio workers that, “Don’t sell your house, don’t sell your house because no more factories are going to close.” What I saw last night was all about him. He didn’t speak to you or your concerns or the American people even once. 
Donald Trump broke his promise. He said he was running for the forgotten American. As soon as he got elected, he forgot them. I’ll never forget. You know, I understand what you do. Wall Street did not build this country. CEOs did not build this country, hard working average American people, given half a chance, built this country. The middle-class built country and unions built the middle class. I tell you what, I never forget that where I came from. A measure our successes as a nation is not how well the stock market is doing. It’s what families are able to talk about and what they deal with at their kitchen table. 
Many of the people who will hear this today woke up this morning at a kitchen table where there was one less, was an empty chair or one less chair, because they lost someone. 205,000 dead because of COVID. Over 7 million infected. It’s just … And what happened last night? Did you hear a word from the president about any of that? Look tables like the one that we saw last night are ones that were set by Trump. For 36 years, as I said, I took a 250 mile round trip on Amtrak every day to commute from Wilmington to Washington. I got to know the engineers, the conductors, the folks in the food service card. 
At night as I’d ride home and going between Washington and Baltimore, I see those lights on and those homes along the tracks, middle-class homes, three bedroom split-level types that I grew up in, and I’d often wonder, “What are they talking about? What are they dealing with? What’s going on in their heads? What was it like what’s going on at my house? “No, honey, you got to ride on those tires for another four or five, 6,000 miles. We can’t afford new ones right now.”” Or who’s going to tell her? Who’s going to tell him they can’t go back to that school because we just don’t have the money? Or what are we going to do? 
I can remember my father, we lived in a three bedroom house with four kids and a grandpop. I can remember the walls were thin. I can remember my dad rolling around at night. I could hear him. Our room was next to him. I remember asking my mom one day, “What’s the matter with dad?” She said, “We just lost the insurance. We have no health insurance.” So look, these are the things that people are worried about. My guess is that the same thing is happening everywhere in America. The question people are asking is, is it going to be okay? 
Folks, this election, in my view, is between Scranton and Park Avenue, between Alliance and Park Avenue. It’s about whether or not the parents are going to look their kids in the eye and going to be able to say, “It’s going to be okay.” That’s what we talked about on the way down here on the train. We talked about it all along this whistle stop tour because I’m coming into places where people are hurting, where people have lost their jobs, but where there used to be real opportunity. This is all about, in my view, how we’re going to support working families to give people an equal shot, just so they can be able to have a chance to be able to just make a decent living. 
And folks to protect your pensions, your healthcare, to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share. To me, that’s what this is all about. It’s a trade-off. Do we allow corporate America to continue to pay [inaudible 00:07:21] pay no tax at all while you’re having your healthcare taken away in the name of, “We can’t afford it.” Do we allow billionaire to get another $30 billion tax break So they pay a lower rate than you pay if you have a job as a school teacher? Do we allow that? Or do we invest in our schools? What should we be doing right now? And what should we be doing for the last five months? 
The president, instead of being in the sand trap in his golf course, should be in the White House and the Oval Office, inviting Democrats and Republicans to be there with him and to settle, settle how we’re going to make sure we can bail out the small businesses that are going under. Make sure people can keep their insurance, making sure we have the ability to open our stores and our schools safely. It costs money to do that, but what’s he doing? He’s doing nothing. 
By the way, I find it fascinating. They had time at the very end of this election to hold a hearing on a Supreme Court justice, but the Senate does not have time to deal with making sure schools and businesses have the PPE they need, the protective gear, does not have the sanitary conditions available to them and the money to pay for them to open up, does not have the capacity and so on. It’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? They have time to rush through a nominee after an election has already started, but no time to deal with the everyday concerns about the American people. 
Look, let me conclude by saying, not withstanding where we are right now, I am extremely optimistic. I’m optimistic because the American people know this is not who we are. They’re ready to get up again. They’re ready to come back. We just have to give them a shot. So we’re better positioned than any nation in the world to take back this 21st century, we’re ready to do it, but we’re going to only do it if we do it together. If I get elected president, I’m not going to be the Democrat president, I’m going to be an American president. I’m going to represent you whether you vote for me or you vote against me. This is about the United States of America, our place in the world and the security and wellbeing of people just given an equal chance, an equal chance to have a shot at the American dream that’s been denied them right now. 
Thank you very much for listening. I’m happy to take questions. I don’t even know where to start. I guess I’ll start and work my way a little bit. Yes? 
It’s not an inconsequential assertion. Look, he did what I expected him to do last night. He announced what he was going to do. He announced he was going to … I think the phrase was, “Now we can become really vicious.” I think that was his phrase, at some point. Look, last night reinforced for me why I got in this race in the first place. Last night, and I said, when I got in the race, we were in the battle for the soul of this country. 
Can you all see me? Should I turn this way a little bit? 
Trump’s constant disregard and unwillingness to speak to COVID and the fact that 205 thousand people have already died, and over 7 million are infected and it’s likely to get worse. He didn’t want to talk about it at all. 
In terms of election legitimacy, he made it clear that if he lost, it wouldn’t be a legitimate election. Already began to plant seeds of doubt in the legitimacy of this election. I don’t know any president’s ever done that before. His dog whistle, the white supremacy, when asked, “Would he condemn white supremacy?” He didn’t say a word. Then when I said, “Well, how about the Proud Boys?” Which is a white supremacist group. He said, “Well, I just told them to stand down and stand ready,” stand down and stand ready based on the outcome of the election? 
Last night was, I think, a wake up call for all Americans. What I tried to do, last night, I tried to speak directly into the camera to the American people, to talk about their concerns, to talk about what’s on their mind, to talk about what I would do, were I president. Trump has no plants, no ideas, didn’t express a single plan that he had about how he’s going to move forward. It made me realize just how much is at stake. For 90 minutes, he tried everything to distract, everything possible and it just didn’t work. But I hope that this next debate is going to be in front of real live people, it’s going to be a town hall. I just hope we’re able to … I’m looking forward to it. I hope we’re able to get a chance to actually answer the questions that are asked by the persons in the room, but God only knows what he’ll do. Yes. 
Well he not only attacked me constantly, and my family, but he attacked the moderator. Again, on his tweets this morning or last night. I just hope there’s a way of which the debate commission can control the ability of us to answer the question without interruptions. I’m not going to speculate on what happens in the second or third debate. My hope is that they’re able to literally say, “The question gets asked of Trump. He has the microphone, he has two minutes to answer the question. No one else has a microphone.” Then I don’t know what the actual rules are going to be, literally, but that would seem to me to make some sense, but I’m looking forward to it. 
I can understand it. It was … I kind of thought, at one point, maybe I shouldn’t say this, but the president of the United States conducted himself the way he did. I think it was just a national embarrassment. But look, I just hope that the American people and those undecided voters try to determine what each of us has an answer for their concerns and allows us to actually speak. Yes. 
Cease and desist. Cease and desist. The American people will decide who the next president of United States will be period. So I’m urging the American people go out and vote, show up. If you can vote early, vote early, vote whatever way is most convenient for you, but vote. If you show up in large enough numbers, nothing is going to change. 
I promise you if in fact we win this election, this president will step down. It’s a lot of bravado. He has no alternative. The American people will not stand for it, no agency would stand for that happening. My message to the Proud Boys and every other white supremacist group is cease and desist. That’s not who we are. This is not who we are as Americans. 
All right, I’m going to let you pick somebody because you got everybody out here. 
I think this works, yes. 
No, I haven’t. I appreciated her endorsement. Look, we had a debate with, I don’t know, 20 to 25 people in the Democratic Party. I said at the time that I would tell you exactly what I believed and I would say why I believed it and why I was running. That’s exactly what I did. I did not support Medicare for all. I do not support it now. I support the Biden plan that I’ve laid out. I’ve laid out the most extensive plan with the detail on how I will get us to net zero emissions in the energy sector by 2035, putting thousands of people to work. I’ve laid out how, in fact, I’m going to get us to net zero emissions in the United States of America by 2050 across the board, how I’d rejoin the Paris Accord, which I helped put together, et cetera. 
So the Green New Deal that the president keeps trying to talk about, it’s not a bad deal, but it’s not the plan I have, that’s the Biden green deal. That’s what this is about. What the president keeps trying to do is he’s trying to run somebody other than me. I’ve said to the left, to the right, and the center, exactly where I am on each of these issues. I did have time and I’ve worked very hard with all segments of the party. We put together a platform that is a platform that I fully support. 
The President keeps talking about … What’s he call it? He has some name for our platform, I can’t remember what it is. Is the- 
The manifesto. Thank you. The manifesto. Well, the Democratic platform is the one that I’ve signed on to. The one that the vast majority, overwhelming majority, of Democrats signed on to. But the democratic party is a big tent and we have all kinds of folks in it that have different views and they’re all welcome. We negotiated, we debated and we had a primary election and I won and I’ve laid out what we’re going to do. So I’m not worried about losing the left, right, or the center of the party, this is a big party, but I have one of the most progressive records any Democrats run on. I’m proud of it, but it’s my record, and it’s what I want to do. So thank you. Thank you very much. 
You don’t mind, I’m going to get in trouble with the conductor because I’d like to stay and answer a lot of your questions. Do I think he’s created a crisis in confidence? Look, all you have to do is look at the polls all your networks run, and a significant member of the American people are worried about what he recommends having anything to do with … Look there, right? Is that what you’re trying to tell me? To deal with the COVID crisis. They’ve lost confidence in him. 
So that’s why I think it’s really important that the scientists continue to speak out, say exactly what constitutes an appropriate approach to dealing with COVID, whether it is a vaccine or any other proposal, and God willing, we’re going to have a vaccine sooner than later, God willing, we’ll be able to distribute it as rapidly as possible. 
But it gets down to, ultimately, the American people have to have trust in the what the president says, and it’s quite clear, many, many, many people don’t trust him. As it relates as well to businesses. They say, “Open up.” Even businesses opened up are having trouble getting people to come in because, in fact, the president says things that are just not accurate. 
But I’m confident that we’re going to get in this train or y’all are going to have to run behind it and we got to get going. But thank you all very much. I’ll talk to you the next stop, wherever I’m doing. Thank you."
47,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-train-tour-speech-transcript-cleveland-ohio-september-30,"Joe Biden Train Tour Speech Transcript Cleveland, Ohio September 30","Hey everybody. I have to tell y’all, it’s great to see you. 
Hello Cleveland. Don’t jump. Folks, I was reminiscing as we drove to the station, I spent the bulk of my adult life driving to an Amtrak station. I commuted every day from Wilmington, Delaware to Washington DC when I got elected as a young Senator, right after my wife and daughter were killed, and I didn’t plan on staying in the Senate, but I agreed I’d stay for six months, a long time ago, and I started commuting and the fact is they tell me I’ve logged more than 2,100,000 miles on Amtrak. So it’s good to be here. It’s not as fast as the helicopter, but I made a lot of family and friends on Amtrak. So I’m looking forward to getting on the train with you guys. 
I want to start off by saying that it’s great to be in Ohio and with my so many friends, members of Congress, local elected officials. It’s an honor to be here with Tiffany. I know how hard it is for her. And I say I know, I was in the position of her children. My dad went through the same thing, Mr. Mayor. Back in Scranton, Pennsylvania, he lost his job. And I remember him walking up the stairs, making what I call that longest walk a parent has to make to tell a child that he’s going to have to leave. My dad didn’t have an eight hour ride. He only had a three hour ride, three and a half hour ride. He moved to Wilmington, Delaware. Took a couple of years before he could bring us back down to Delaware, come home every weekend, but to make sure that we’re all together again. It’s a hard slog. A lot of people have made that. And Tiffany, you’re a wonderful, wonderful mother, teacher, and the way you talk about your husband, he and I have something in common. We both married way up. I want to say that my dad, when he was, I apologize to Congressman Lamb, he’s heard me say this a lot, but my dad, when we moved back to Delaware, moved to Delaware, would say all the time to his children, my siblings and I, he’d say, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to hold your head up. It’s being able to look your child in the eye and say, it’s going to be okay. That’s what a job is about.” And Tiffany, when I think about your husband taking that job eight hours away, although it’s a hundred years ago, I think about my dad, and I imagine your husband has the same stamina, and you do, as my mom and dad did. 
The fact is that last night’s debate, and this election, is supposed to be about you, Tiffany, about you and all the people I grew up with in Scranton, and people in Youngstown, and Claymont, Delaware, and all the people who make a difference. Does any President, does your President understand at all what you’re going through, what so many other people are going through? Question is does he see you where you are and where you want to be? Does he care? As he tried to walk in your shoes, to understand what’s going on in your life? Or does he just ignore you and all the folks all over America who are in a similar situation? I think he’s more than ignoring us. I look at things from Scranton’s perspective, he looks at from Park Avenue. I think he basically looks down on us. He judges us. 
The fact is that I think that when he called our military, and I see we got some veterans here too, thank you for your service man, but when he called our veterans who lost their lives and served suckers and losers, I thought it was one of the most despicable things that I’ve ever heard a President say. Guys you are soldiers or a veteran, you served your country, like you did, like you did Connor, like my son did. What he does, he lies to you. He lies to you about exactly what’s happened. Does he lie to you when, like this president did to your husband, that all the workers at GM plant in Lordstown were going to be in good shape. You remember what he said? 
And you said it to me, he said, “Don’t move. Don’t sell your house because no Ohio factory will shut down in Donald Trump’s America.” He doesn’t pay his fair share, don’t worry about that. He doesn’t pay his fair share in taxes. He says that makes him smart. What does that do? What does that make you, Tiffany, make me, and millions of other hard working Americans, decent people who pay our taxes? Are we the suckers? Are we stupid because we go by the rules? He’s too weak to beat the pandemic. Cost him more than 200,000 American lives. That’s upended every part of our lives and hit working people particularly hard. Your businesses are closed and schools aren’t back to normal because Donald Trump hasn’t done his job. 
He hasn’t pulled Congress together to provide real relief for working people, moms, and dads, and business owners. The fact is Congress has passed a significant recovery bill, but he’s too busy being in a bunker, or in his golf course to call them into the White House to work out an agreement. He told FEMA to cut off funding for school PPE, masks, and protective gear, because it’s not a national emergency. His response during the deadly pandemic is to try to take your healthcare away by asking the Supreme Court to strike the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Wipe it out. 
… the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, wipe it out, taking us back to a time when insurance companies could deny you coverage for preexisting conditions. Now, because of COVID, lung scarring or heart problems is a consequence of having survived COVID. That could be the next pre-existing conditions affecting millions of people. Taking away Medicare benefits for seniors. Throw your adult kids off your healthcare insurance. 
Think about his plan for your social security. The social security actuary said that if he follows through on his plan for social security, social security will be quote, “Bankrupt by 2023.” It clear that he not only cares about Wall Street and the super wealthy and the Fortune 500, he thinks they built this country. That’s why he wants another $30 billion tax cut for the hundred wealthiest billionaires in the country, who have already made $ 30 billion during this pandemic. So they’ll pay a lower tax rate than you do as a teacher, a factory worker, a firefighter, a nurse. He gave a tax giveaway for corporations and they moved jobs overseas to sell goods back to the United States. Here comes the train that he tried to make sure didn’t continue to run. 
That’s the commuter. All right. But folks, look, he let big corporation jump in front of the line to get the recovery aid that Congress had passed while small businesses are struggling to say open. In the end, his measure of economic health is the stock market. In four years as president, he’s broken his promise, he’s forgotten the forgotten Americans he said he was always going to fight for. 
Well, I never will forget. I know the middle class working people built this country and I measure our economic success by what families are talking about around their kitchen tables this morning. Some of them with an empty chair because they lost a family member. The ones I saw every night on my train ride from Washington to Wilmington, Delaware, as I said after my wife and daughter were killed when I was first elected, I started going home every single night so I’d be there in the morning to get my kids, Beau Hunter and Ashley ready for school. Actually, Jill, God love her, she came into our life five years later and made things good. 
For 36 years, I said, I took that 250 mile round trip journey each day. I’d get to know the train engineers, the conductors, the fellow passengers, and at night, I’d see the pinpoints of lights in the homes in the cities and towns along the way from Washington to Wilmington and wonder what those families are talking about after they put their kids to bed. My guess is the same thing that all Americans across the country are talking about today, asking questions as profound and as ordinary as, will we be okay? Will we be able to keep our insurance? What are we going to do? 
Folks, this election has a choice between Scranton and Park Avenue values, between Cleveland and Park Avenue values, between Alliance and Park Avenue values. But it’s also about something deeper. Can these parents look their kids in the eye and say, ” Honey, everything’s going to be okay.” These are the conversations I’m going to be having today in this whistle stop tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania, talking to folks about how I’ll get the virus under control, lay out the plan, bringing Congress together to provide relief and resources to schools and business so we can reopen our economy safely and strongly with a real plan and real leadership. 
Talking to folks about how I’d create good paying jobs, union jobs, to support working families and build our economy back. Not just back, but build it back better. I’ll protect your Medicare and social security and how I’ll fight to protect pensions, including fixing [inaudible 00:31:13] employer pensions so that many union women and men in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, Delaware, all across this country, are able to keep what they earned and deserve. 
I’ll fight for American jobs with the dignity of work and make the wealthy and corporations began to pay their fair share. I’ll protect your right to healthcare and build on and improve the Affordable Care Act and I’ll always tell you the truth. I’ll always care about you, whether you vote for me or not. If elected, I’m not going to be a Democratic president, I’m going to be an American president. Whether you voted for me or not, I’m going to be your president and I’ll never forget the people, the working people of this country, because that’s what I’ve come from. That, given just half a chance, the American people can do anything. Just like you, Tiffany, and your husband, you’ve stood up. You can do anything. I want to make something absolutely clear. There’s overwhelming reason for optimism. Reverend, as you said, there’s overwhelming reason. We just have to unite. The country is ready to do that. We’re better positioned than any nation in the world to own the 21st century, we just have to do it and do it together. So I leave you Rev and thank you for your invocation by saying, God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Keep the faith. We’re coming back. Thank you."
48,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-campaign-speech-transcript-manitowoc-wisconsin-september-21,"Joe Biden Campaign Speech Transcript Manitowoc, Wisconsin September 21","Thank you very, very much. And is the [inaudible 00:00:05] family here? Anyone from… as they say in part of my city, your family done good. Long, long time. Isn’t it? God love you. Well, thank you. Thank you for taking the time to be here. I really do appreciate it. Today, unfortunately, America is going to, have to speak to this quickly, going to reach a tragic milestone. 200,000 deaths recorded as of today because of the coronavirus. 200,000 deaths all across this nation. And it means there are empty chairs and dining room tables and kitchen tables that weeks and months ago were filled with a loved one, a mom, a dad, a brother, a sister. And in many cases, the pain was made a lot worse because… and I’ve had people tell me this and close friends of the family tell me, because they were unable to visit their elderly parent or grandparent in a nursing home just before they passed away. 
Don’t know how many stories I’ve heard about from the nurses saying they held up a cell phone to the patient on a ventilator in the bed about to pass, Mr. Mayor, and that’s all they could speak to. And so the fact that people weren’t able to hold funeral services where family and friends could pray together, remember the loved ones they lost and place them as they place them in the hands of God. And so many of the rituals we have come to help us cope with pain and loss, to help us honor the lives of those we’ve loved, to help us come to closure, just aren’t available in the middle of this pandemic. What worries me now is we’ve been living with this pandemic for so long, we’re risking becoming numb to the toll it has taken on us and our country and communities like this. We can’t let that happen. 
We can’t lose the ability to feel the sorrow and the loss and the anger for so many lives lost. We can’t let the numbers become statistics, a background noise, just a blur that we see on the nightly news. 200 moms, dads, sons, daughters, grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends, coworkers, who are no longer with us. And so many of them didn’t have to lose their lives to this virus, quite frankly, if only the president has acted sooner. Back in May, Columbia University released a study that said that if the president of that acted just one week sooner, we would have saved 36,000 lives. Today, the leading model being used to track the virus, one which the White House and many the others rely on, that model says between now and the end of this year, while we’re waiting for a vaccine, between now and the end of the year, we’re going to lose up to 200,000 additional lives. 
It ranged from 178,000 to 200,000. And it points out as well that if we act by doing what you’re doing here in Wisconsin, wearing masks and making minimum requirements to meet this, we could save over 115,000 of those lives. So I hope to God we’ll not learn the same lesson, we might have to learn the same bad lesson we learned in the first nine months. Due to Donald Trump’s lies and incompetence in the past six months have seen one of the greatest losses of American life in history, in history. But sadly, it’s not over. As awful as the past 180 days have been, the next 90 days could be twice as bad. Just pause and think about it. We could be looking at, as I said, between 178 and 200,000 lives lost. And all the president does is deliberately change the subject, which is especially infuriating. Once again, we’re being told that we can save lives. This time as many, as I said, 110,000 lives if we just take the simple steps. 
Chief among them wearing masks and still the president refuses. In fact, we just watched him hold an indoor rally with thousands of people, many of whom weren’t wearing masks despite the clear evidence that we’re putting everyone of those people’s lives at risk. The president knew of these dangers back in February and he hid it from the American people. You can actually hear his own voice recorded by Bob Woodward’s interview with him saying that he understood how bad it was. We hear him privately saying, “This is a deadly virus. Far more deadly than any flu.” But that’s not what he was saying to us publicly. Publicly he told us that it was just like the flu and it would disappear in the warm weather like a miracle. 
It was all a lie. He knew it. What’s his explanation? He said he didn’t want to see the American people panic. He didn’t want to panic them. Trump panicked. The virus was too big for him. All his life, Donald Trump has been bailed out of any problem he faced. And with this crisis, a real crisis, the crisis that required serious presidential leadership, he just wasn’t up to it. He froze. He failed to act. He panicked and America has paid the worst price of nation in the world. Still, I support and understand what Donald Trump was saying. And by the way, the American people don’t panic. We don’t panic. I understand what he was saying because it crystallizes his whole worldview. When Donald Trump said he didn’t want to create a panic, he wasn’t just talking about a health panic, he was focused on the stock market. Trump was worried that if he told the public the truth, there would be a panic on the financial markets and that would hurt his chances of being reelected. 
That’s how Donald Trump views the world. He sees the world from Park Avenue. I see it from where I grew up in a town like this from Scranton, Pennsylvania. Hard scrapple, hard working town, just like this and so many more across Wisconsin. When you look at the world from Park Avenue, basically all you can see is Wall Street. And you think Wall Street built this country? Well, let me tell you. You think that Donald Trump as Donald Trump does, that handing out a $1.5 trillion tax giveaway primarily for large corporations and wealthy qualifiers is an economic plan? You think like Trump, that $15 an hour is too much for America’s essential workers. You eliminate overtime pay for millions of American workers. You try to take away healthcare from 20 million Americans in the middle of this pandemic. 
He’s in court today, trying to get that done. You trying to take away protections for preexisting conditions for 130 million Americans. You propose a plan that in order to make it look good, you’re going to get a little bump in your pay because you’re not going to take out withholding for your social security. But guess what? The actuary at social security says if he does that social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. You might get that out of your paycheck, a little more in your paycheck, but guess what? Go home and tell your mom and dad, say goodbye to social security they worked for their whole lives. You think being tough with China is a trade deal that opens the door to big banks to make money in China. That’s basically all we got out of it. A lot of dairy farmers and farmers and manufacturing went under. 
But guess what? It started a trade war that [inaudible 00:08:38] farm banker fees and America throws the American manufacturing into a recession. But you know what happened? I didn’t know this at first. I couldn’t understand why he was so excited about it. America’s bank, Citibank, they got to open up in Beijing. They weren’t able to before. He scuttled a deal to lower prescription drug prices. He probably had a deal, but he wanted the pharmaceutical companies before they lowered the prices to do something that they thought was unethical. He asked them to send out $100 checks with his name on it to the elderly saying that, that’s the down payment. They said, “We’re not going to do that.” They weren’t going to do it so the deal fell apart. And now some 30 million Americans are on unemployment. 
You think the way to get American economy back on track is to give another gigantic multimillion dollar tax cut to the very wealthy. And here’s what they’re doing. The tax rate all of you pay in here is going to be higher than billionaires who make their money on investments. This is not exaggeration. He wants to lower, again, costing $30 billion to the Treasury, lower the capital gains tax to 15%. So while someone who makes their money is off the market is paying the 15% rate, you’re paying at a 24, 26, 28, depending on your tax bracket rate. It’s not right. Workers here pay close to twice that amount. Close to 30%. Trump’s tax cut for the wealthy is going to cost billions of dollars a year and who’s hide does it come out? It comes out of your hide. The simple truth is that Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten man and women in this country. 
And then once he got in office, he forgot us. Not only did he forget them, the truth is that he never really respected us very much. Oh, he loves his rallies but the next time he holds one look closely. Trump keeps his distance from anyone in the rally. The folks who come are packed in tight as they can be risking disease, mostly without mask, but not Trump. He safely he keeps his distance. They showed a couple of days ago, a reporter trying to come up or someone come through, he said, “No, no. You got to keep your distance. I don’t get close to these people.” He’s willing to let everybody else in the crowd risk their life, but not him. And now we know what he really thinks of the people who come to his rallies from someone who saw it up close and wrote about it up close in the White House. The former employee said he calls his own supporters, “Disgusting.” He said one of the benefits of this pandemic, cause he doesn’t have to shake their hands. 
He doesn’t have to shake their hand. That’s a good thing about the pandemic. For Trump these rallies are about entertainment, adoration and not respect. But you don’t kid yourself, this is a one way street. And all the things that Trump has said and done, nothing is more offensive than the way he’s spoken about many of you and the brave women and men who served the nation in uniform. Those have given their lives in service to this nation. It’s been confirmed by every outlet that he referred to them as losers and suckers. That’s what Trump calls those who served and They’re made the ultimate sacrifice. Let me tell you something, my son Beau served and volunteered to go to Iraq for a year. Won the Bronze Star, came home decorated, came home with stage 4 glioblastoma and died of cancer. He wasn’t a loser. He wasn’t a sucker. He was a patriot. 
And all those people with whom he served, volunteered, were patriots as well. Just like your sons and daughters and many of you, your moms and dads. Frankly, I’ve dealt with guys like Trump my whole life. Some neighbor where I come who would look down on us because we didn’t have a lot of money or your parents didn’t go to college. Guys who think they’re better than you. Guys who inherit everything they’ve ever gotten in their life and squander it. Guys who stretch and squeeze and stiff electricians and plumbers and contractors working on their hotels and casinos and golf courses just to put a few more bucks in their pocket. Guys who do everything they can to avoid paying their taxes they owe because they figure the rest of us, the little people, we can pick up the tab for the country. Do you have any doubt that the reason we haven’t seen Trump’s tax returns is because they didn’t want to know what he paid? 
They’ve only seen four Trump tax returns in the last 45 years. And I don’t think there’s been any ever since he’s been running for president. He had to turn some of them over to start a casino in New Jersey. He had to show his taxes. And they showed that he paid zero. He talked about the billion dollars that… he paid zero, nothing. That’s a fact. And when he was asked about it, you know what he said? This why I really don’t like guys like this in my neighborhood. He said, “It makes me smart.” Or in another way, “I’m not a sucker. Why should I pay when I can figure my way out?” Zero. Wall Street’s a long way from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and here, but you get to see the world a little more clearly there. I grew up understanding as I believe all of you did that Wall Street didn’t build this country, hardworking people, given half a chance, the middle class built this country and unions built the middle class. 
Unions. Union labor like the folks in this room. I’ve learned a few simple lessons from my parents that I’ve never forgotten. One is from my mother. She used to say, and this the God’s truth, “Joey, remember nobody’s better than you, but everyone’s your equal. Nobody’s better, but everyone’s your equal.” It’s pretty simple. We’re all equal the way I was raised and we should be treated that way. I have to admit, I got my back up a little bit recently about something I saw and was on national television about the race. Some of the national… I don’t think they meant anything by it, but I don’t think they know how insulting it is. It was, Joe Biden, if elected, will be only the first president who didn’t go to an Ivy League school in a long time. Somehow that meant I didn’t belong. 
How could a guy who went to a state school be president? My reaction was the same it has been my whole life and I have to admit it and I’m not proud of it, but you close the door on me because you think I’m not good enough, guess what? Like all you guys, I’m going to bust down that door. My guess is a lot of you feel the same way about a lot of slights you’ve had because of our standing, quote, unquote. I say it’s about time that a state school president sat in the Oval Office because you know what? If I’m sitting there, you’re going to be sitting there too. Another lesson I learned from my dad and my family heard this all the time. My dad lost a job when coal died up in Scranton. We had to move. He had to go to my grandpa, his father-in-law and say, “Can Gen…” My mom. “Can Gen and the kids stay with you about a year? I’ll make it up to you. I got to move to Delaware where there’s a job. I’m going to come home every weekend.” 
Talk about pride. Well, he used to say, “Joey, remember a job’s about a lot more than your paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community. It’s about being able to look your kids in the eye and say, honey, it’s going to be all right.” The dignity of work, what you do matters. You matter. That’s why I want to change the tax code. Instead of rewarding just wealth, and I don’t want to punish anybody, but instead of just rewarding wealth in this country, it’s about time we start to reward work. Under my plan nobody making less than 400,000 bucks and I don’t make it and you don’t make it. I don’t think. In this country will see their taxes go up. But if you make more than 400,000 bucks, you’re going to start to pay more. I’m not looking to punish anyone. I just think it’s about time the wealthiest and the biggest corporations, most profitable companies began to pay their fair share. You got all 90 of them paying zero. Making billions of dollars. They pay no tax at all. Zero. 
How can that be fair? The president talks all the time about how great the economy is. Well, I don’t know what y’all think, but where I come from and a lot of places in this state, it’s not so great. In the middle of this pandemic, now, the billionaires in this country have seen their wealth increase by $800 billion. Let me explain that again. All the billionaires in America during the pandemic, their net worth combined according to studies have increased by $800 billion. And the rest of us, well, 30 million people are unemployed. 20 million Americans are at risk of losing their home because they can’t find the rent payment. Seven plus million Americans are working part time who want to work full time. Evictions are on the rise. And for a lot of families, the kids are at home, not in school. I believe it’s the working people of this country that need a tax break. 
And under my plan, they’re going to get one. Whether you’re buying your first home, paying for health care premium or childcare or caring for an aging parent, you’re going to be able to afford it. I’ve said it many times, during this pandemic, we need to do more than just praise our essential workers, we need to pay them. We need to make healthcare affordable for every American. My plan will lower prescription drug costs by 60%. I’m going to make sure we keep protections for preexisting conditions that Obama and I put in place and make it a lot more affordable to have that healthcare. We need to empower labor unions in this country. Fair Labor Standards Act didn’t say back in the ’30s, you can’t have labor unions. It said we should promote labor unions. That’s what it said. And I will. 
And one more thing. Under my Build Back Better plan, we’re not only going to build infrastructure we need in this country with union workers and prevailing wage, we’re going to do something else. We’re going to rebuild manufacturing in this country and we’ll do it by enforcing a real buy American plan. Look, the federal government has spent $600 billion a year in purchasing power that the federal government has every year from tax dollars and determines how it’s used. When I’m president of United States, God willing, American companies with American workers, building American products using American supply chains are going to be the only ones who get the contracts. That means American aluminum for infrastructure, for developing more wind and solar and hydroelectric power, electric vehicles will replace cars in the federal fleet. We have one of the largest fleets in the world, the federal government. They’re going to shift them all to electric vehicles and guess what? 
That means you’re going to be providing much more lighter frames, more aluminum for automobiles that already if they are aluminum built, they could reduce by 15%, even with a combustion engine. 1.5 million new affordable homes and housing. We’re going to build and this is going to require a lot of work and increased work at home. We’re going to make sure that we transfer 40 million buildings around America to make them weather resistant so that they are… you change the windows, the doors, the walls, the whole range. Building Back Better means firing up our shuttered foundries and forging ahead towards future that’s truly made in America. I want to spend just a few moments talking about those who voted for Donald Trump last time. When I went was out here in the [inaudible 00:22:06] administration, you voted for us and then an awful lot of people in this county changed and they voted for Trump last time. 
I know many of you were frustrated. You were angry. You believed you weren’t being seen, represented or heard. I get it. It has to change. And I promise you this, it will change with me. You will be seen, heard and respected by me. This campaign isn’t about just winning votes, it’s about restoring the basic dignity in this country that every worker deserves. Basic dignity that we all have without winning back the hearts and yes, the soul of America, we’re not going to make it. Just a few days ago when I was asked about the death count approaching 200,000, the president said, and I quote, he said, I won’t quote him. The president said, “If you take out the blue states run by Democratic governors and just look at the red states, Republican governors are doing quite well.” 
Now, of course, it’s a simple, factual matter, it’s just not true. If you just count all the deaths in the red states, we are number two in the world in death just behind Brazil. But more fundamentally, reflects on the part of Donald Trump that he has a deeply flawed and divisive view of the United States, this nation and the job he holds. Think about what he’s saying. He’s saying, if you live in a state like Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, states with Democratic governors, you’re not his problem. He has no obligation to you. He’s not responsible for you as president, your family or your wellbeing. I don’t see the presidency that way. I don’t pledge allegiance to red states of America or blue states of America, I pledge allegiance to the United States of America. One nation, indivisible under God. For real. I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m not going to govern as a Democratic president, I’m going to govern as president. 
I get criticized for saying that sometimes with some in my party, but that’s not what I’m going to do. I’m going to fight as hard for those who supported me as those who did not support me. This is not a partisan moment for God’s sake. This has to be an American moment. In the next few weeks, we have a chance to put anger and division and the darkness that overtaken this country behind us. We’ve got to put it behind us. I know I’ve been criticized since I entered the primaries about, I say, I want to unite the country. We have to unite the country. This is not who we are and we can. We’ve done it so many times in our history. We’ve begun to a new. If we get control of this virus, we can. We can reward work. We can fix the healthcare system. 
We can be a safe and just nation. We can deal with the existential threat of climate change which aluminum is going to be a gigantic part of. We can be what we are at our best, one nation. One nation, one people, one America. You just have to remember who in God’s name we are. This is the United States of America. In our long history, there’s been nothing we’ve been unable to do, nothing we’ve been able to overcome when we’ve done it together. And I’m confident going all over this nation, we can do it together. The American people are hungry. We have to bring the nation together. That’s going to be my primary job. Ans I want to thank you all. God bless you for what you’re doing. May you all stay safe and may God protect our troops. Thank you so much, Mr. Mayor. Thank you. And thank you ma’am. Appreciate it."
49,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-philadelphia-speech-transcript-sept-20-accuses-trump-republicans-of-abuse-of-power-over-scotus,Joe Biden Philadelphia Speech Transcript Sept. 20: Accuses Trump & Republicans of Abuse of Power Over SCOTUS,"Welcome to the nation’s Constitution Center. I had the great privilege of being a guest here. It’s an appropriate place to make the speech I’m about to make. I attended a mass earlier today and prayed for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her family. The nation lost a heroine, an icon. They also lost a mother, a grandmother, and a matriarch. We know how hard that is, to watch a piece of your soul absorb the cruelty and the pain of the dreadful disease of cancer. I spoke to her daughter and her granddaughter last night, expressing my whole family, I mean, my whole family’s sorrow, particularly my grown granddaughters, one of whom was a student of Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s daughter at Columbia. They made clear to me, daughter and granddaughter, that until the very end, Justice Ginsburg displayed the character and courage we’d expect of her. They said she held their hands and gave them strength and purpose to carry on. 
It’s been noted that she passed away on Rosh Hashanah. By tradition, a person who dies during the Jewish new year is considered a soul of great righteousness. That was Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a righteous soul. It was my great honor, when I was in the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to preside over her confirmation hearings and strongly support her ascension to the Supreme Court bench. Justice Ginsburg achieved a standing few justices have or ever will. She became a presence in the lives of so many Americans and a part of our culture. 
I agree with what others have said, that she did as much to advance the constitutional rights, opportunities, and justice for women as Justice Marshall did for African Americans. Yes, there was humor and mentions of the Notorious RBG and her impressive exercise routines, but there was so much more. She was, to use an overused word, a trailblazer, a role model, a source of hope and a powerful voice for justice. She was proof, proof that courage and conviction and moral clarity can change not only the law, it can change our culture. It can change the world. And I believe in the days and months and years ahead, excuse me, she will continue to inspire millions of Americans all across this country. And together we can, and we will, continue to be a voice for justice in her name. 
Her granddaughter said yesterday and said publicly that her dying words were, “My most fervent wish is that I not be replaced until a new president is installed.” As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads. There’s so much at stake, the right to healthcare, clean air, clean water, the environment, equal pay for equal work, the rights of voters, immigrants, women, workers. And right now our country faces a choice, a choice about whether we will come back from the brink. 
That’s what I would like to talk with you about for a few minutes today. Within an hour of news of her passing, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said President Trump’s nominee to replace Justice Ginsburg will receive a vote in the Senate. Within an hour of her passing. The exact opposite of what he said when President Obama nominated Merrick Garland to replace Justice Scalia in 2016. At that time, Majority Leader McConnell made up a rule based on the fiction that I somehow believe there should be no nomination to the court in an election year. That’s ridiculous. The only rule I’ve ever followed relating to the Supreme Court nomination was the Constitution’s obligation for senators to provide their advice and their consent to a president’s judicial nominee. 
But he created a new rule, the McConnell rule. Absolutely no hearing, no vote for a nominee in an election year, period, no caveats, and many Republican senators agreed with him, including then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, including the current Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who at the time said, and I quote verbatim, here’s what he said. “I want you to use my words against me if there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of the first term. You can say, Lindsey Graham said, let’s let the next president, whoever it might be, make the nomination.” Continuing to quote, “And you could use my words against me, and you’d be absolutely right.” End of quote. That’s what Republicans said when Justice Scalia passed away about nine months before election day that year. 
Now, having lost Justice Ginsburg less than seven weeks before the election this year, after Americans have already begun to cast their vote. It’s estimated that up to 40% of Americans will have voted by October 1st, but at least 30%. Tens of millions. And you can’t unring the bell. Having made this their standard when it served their interests, they cannot just four years later change course when it doesn’t serve their ends. Look, I’m not being naive. I’m not speaking to President Trump, who will do whatever he wants. I’m not speaking to Mitch McConnell, who will do what he wants, and he does. I’m speaking to those Republicans out there, Senate Republicans, who know deep down what is right for the country and consistent with the Constitution, as I stand here in the Constitution Center, not just what’s best for their party. 
I’m speaking for millions of Americans out there who already have voted and continue to vote, and we’ll have many more voted by the time this process is finished. Millions of Americans who are voting because they know their healthcare hangs in the balance. In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump is before the Supreme Court, trying to strip healthcare coverage away from tens of millions of families. This took away the peace of mind of more than 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions. If he succeeds, insurers could once again discriminate or drop coverage completely for people living with preexisting conditions, like asthma, diabetes, cancer, and so many other problems. 
And perhaps most cruelly of all, if Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be, it’s estimated that 200 million people have died probably by the time I finish this talk, the complications of COVID-19, like lung scarring and heart damage, could become the next deniable preexisting condition for over six million Americans who’ve already contracted the disease. 
Millions of Americans are also voting because they don’t want nearly half a century of legal precedent to be overturned and lose the right to choose. Millions of Americans who are at risk of losing their right to vote. Millions of Dreamers who are at risk of being expelled from the only country they have ever known. Millions of workers. Union workers who are at risk of losing their right to collectively bargain. Millions of Americans who are demanding that their voices be heard, that equal justice be a guarantee for all, not just some. They know, we all know, what should happen now. The voters of this country should be heard. As I said, voting has already begun. By the time we get to the middle of October, there will be millions and millions and millions who have already voted. In just a few weeks, all votes in this nation will be heard. They’re the ones who the Constitution envisions should decide who has the power to make this appointment. 
This appointment isn’t about the past. It’s about the future, and the people of this nation, and the people of this nation are choosing their future right now, as they vote. To jam this nomination through the Senate is just an exercise in raw political power, and I don’t believe that the people of this nation will stand for it. President Trump has already made it clear, this is about power, pure and simple power. Whether the voters should make it clear on this issue and so many others, the power in this nation resides with them, the American people, the voters, and even if President Trump wants to put forward a name now, the Senate should not act until after the American people select their next president, their next Congress, their next Senate. If Donald Trump wins the election, then the Senate should move on his selection and weigh the nominee he chooses fairly. 
But if I win this election, President Trump’s nominee should be withdrawn, and as a new president I should be the one who nominates Justice Ginsburg’s successor, a nominee who should get a fair hearing in the Senate before a confirmation hearing, before a confirmation vote, I should say, after a confirmation hearing. 
We’re in the middle of a pandemic. Like I said, as I speak, we’re probably passing 200,000 deaths lost to this virus. Tens of millions of Americans are unemployed. Healthcare in this country hangs in the balance before the court. And now, in a raw political move, this president and the Republican leader have decided to jam a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court through the United States Senate. That’s the last thing we need at this moment. As I said, voters have already begun casting their votes in the millions. And in just a few weeks, we’re going to know who the voters of this nation have chosen as the next president. The United States Constitution was designed to give voters one chance, one chance to have their voice heard in who serves on the court. And by the way, there’s no court session between now and the end of this election. 
That moment is now for the voters to get a chance to be heard, and their voice should be heard. And I believe voters are going to make it clear. They’ll not stand for this abuse of power, this constitutional abuse. There’s no discussion about what happens if the Senate confirms on the eve of election or in a lame duck after Donald Trump loses. A successor to Justice Ginsburg, what happens? But that discussion assumes that we lose this effort to prevent the grave wrong that Trump and McConnell are pursuing here. I’m not going to assume failure at this point. I believe the voices of the American people should be heard and will be heard. This vote, this fight, this nomination will not be over until the Senate votes, if it does vote. Winning that vote, if it happens, is everything. Action and reaction, anger and more anger, sorrow and frustration at the way things are in this country now politically, that’s the cycle that Republican senators will continue to perpetuate if they go down this dangerous path that they put us on. 
We need to deescalate, not escalate. That’s why I appeal to those few Senate Republicans, the handful who really will decide what happens. Please, follow your conscience. Don’t vote to confirm anyone nominated under the circumstances President Trump and Senator McConnell have created. Don’t go there. Uphold your constitutional duty, your conscience. Let the people speak. Cool the flames that have been engulfing our country. We can’t keep rewriting history, scrambling norms, ignoring our cherished system of checks and balances. That includes this whole business of releasing a list of potential nominees that I would put forward. They’re now saying, after Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, they said, “Biden should release his list.” It’s no wonder the Trump campaign asked that I release the list only after she passed away. It’s a game for them. It’s a play to [inaudible 00:19:44] up emotions and anger. 
There’s a reason why no presidential candidate, other than Donald Trump, has ever done such a thing. First, putting a judge’s name on a list like that could influence that person’s decision making as a judge, and that would be wrong, or at least create the perception that it would have influence. Second, anyone put on a list like that under these circumstances will be subject to unrelenting political attacks. Because any nominee I would select would not get a hearing until 2021 at the earliest, she would endure those attacks for months on end, without being able to defend herself. Thirdly, and finally, perhaps most importantly, if I win, I’ll make my choice for the Supreme Court not based on a partisan election campaign, but on what prior presidents have done, Republican and Democrats, and I’ve served with many of them. 
Only after consulting Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate and seeking their advice and asking for the consent, it says, “Advice and consent of the Senate,” the president is the person who gets to name someone, propose. The Senate deposes. As everyone knows, I made it clear that my first choice for the Supreme Court will make history as the first African American woman justice. But I’ll consult with senators in both parties about that pick, as well as the legal and civil leaders in our country. In the end, the choice will be mine and mine alone, but I will consult. It will be the product of a process that restores our finest traditions, not the extension of one that’s torn this country apart the last years. 
So let me conclude with this. As I’ve said in this campaign, we’re in the battle for the soul of this country. We face historic crises, once in a generation pandemic, a devastating economic recession, the rise of white supremacy that the FBI directors warned us against, unseen since the sixties, and a reckoning on race that’s long overdue, a challenging climate, a changing climate that is ravaging our nation and the world as we speak. Supreme Court decisions will touch every part of these crises, every part of our lives and our future. The last thing we need is to add a constitutional crisis that plunges us deeper into the abyss, deeper into the darkness. 
If we go down this path, I predict it will cause irreversible damage. The infection this president has unleashed on our democracy can be fatal. Enough. Enough. Enough. We must come together as a nation. Democrats, Republicans, independents, liberals, conservatives, everybody. I’m not saying we have to agree on everything, but we have to reason our way through what ails us as citizens, voters, public service. That’s the guidebook called the Constitution. We have to act in good faith, in mutual goodwill, in the spirit of conciliation, not confrontation. 
This nation will continue to be inspired by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but we should not only be inspired by her, we should be guided by her, by her willingness to listen to those with whom she disagreed, to respect other points of view. Famously, Justice Ginsburg got along well with some of the most conservative justices on the court. And she did it without compromising her principles, clouding her moral clarity, or losing her core principles. If she can do this, so can we. How we talk to one another matters, how we treat one another matters, respecting others matters. Justice Ginsburg proved it’s important to have a spine of steel, but also important to have an open hand, not a clenched fist, to those with whom we disagree. 
This nation needs to come together. I’ve said it many times in this election. We are the United States of America. There’s nothing we cannot overcome. There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together. Donald Trump seems to want to divide this nation between red states and blue states, between representing those states that vote for him and ignoring those who don’t. I do not. I cannot, I will not be that president. I’ll be a president for the whole country, for those who vote for me and those who vote against me. We need to rise in this moment for the sake of the country we love so dearly, indeed for its very soul. May God bless the United States of America. May God protect our troops. And may God bless Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Thank you so much."
50,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-hermantown-minnesota-speech-transcript-september-18,"Joe Biden Hermantown, Minnesota Speech Transcript September 18","Hello, Minnesota. It’s good to be back. As Amy was saying, I’ve been here a number of times up in the Iron Range, and it’s a magnificent part of the world. Magnificent part of the world. And I want to thank you so much, Amy, Senator, you’ve been a great friend and a great, great Senator. And Senator Smith, you’re something else, I’ll tell you what. Thank you for the job you’re doing, and I’m counting on it continuing for another six years. 
I know you’re both fighting around the clock to take care of Minnesotans who are hurting in these multiple crises we face today. We have everything from COVID to unemployment, to a country that is being divided along racial lines. We have institutional racism we’re dealing with. A whole range of things. And the people of Minnesota know that they have two of the best Senators in the country on their side. 
And Matt, thank you so much for that introduction and for showing me around today, this incredible apprentice program here at the Carpenters Training Center. What a lot of people don’t know if they’re not involved with labor is the apprenticeship program not only trains the best workers in the world, I’m not being facetious, that’s a fact, but they get paid while they’re doing it. Not full wage, but they’re getting paid while they’re doing it. And that’s why these union apprenticeship programs are so, so critically important they stay this way. It matters. People who still make it while they’re learning a trade, a trade that’s going to put them in good stead the rest of their lives. 
It was great to see some of the practical hands-on experience that apprentices and journeymen and women here receive and while, as I said, earning a wage as a benefit. It’s a bit quieter here than usual because of COVID-19 restrictions, but the pride of these workers who are learning the skills that will carry them throughout their careers is still unmistakable. 
My father, and I apologize to the press who follows me for repeating this, but it warrants saying every time, my dad used to have an expression. He said, “Joey, a job’s about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in the community.” Then he’d end by saying, “It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, ‘Honey, it’s going to be okay,’ and mean it.” 
That’s the lesson I’ve never forgotten. It’s the way I grew up surrounded by hard working families in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and a lot of steelworkers in Claymont, Delaware. All those jobs are gone now, those steel working jobs. And that’s what I saw here at this training center, dedicated women and men investing in their dignity. In their dignity. 
Here in the Iron Range, we can see the resilience and the grit, the communities that built America, the metal they’re made of. And fortified by the strength of union power, worker power. I think I was saying to you, Matt, that my dad had another expression, “The only way to deal with the abuse of power is with power,” and the only real power for workers in America is union power. You’re the folks who keep the barbarians on the other side of the gate, and making sure that people can make a decent living. 
And folks, but here like everywhere else, times are hard. Unemployment is way up due to the pandemic. Fewer workers can be on the job at one time in order to abide by social distancing roles. And the economic outlook for next year, including for the building trades, is more uncertain than it need be. 
Here in Minnesota and all across the country, there are plenty of folks who are hurting. They’re worried about making their next mortgage payment or keeping their rent payments in check. They see the people at the top of the heap doing very well. An incredible number: billionaires in America during this pandemic have made another $300 billion. Hear what I just said? In the middle of the pandemic. They’re left of wonder, as a consequence, ordinary folks, “Who’s looking out for me?” 
That’s been the entire story of Donald Trump’s presidency. Now, in the midst of this unprecedented national crisis, Trump has given up on even pretending to do his job. Almost 200,000 lives lost in the last six months. And experts tell us now, the same studies the administration’s relied on to predict what’s coming next, that we’re going to lose another 215,000 lives between now and January 1st. The United States has another 36,000 new COVID cases per day. Per day. Another average thousand deaths a day. 
Just across the border, figuratively speaking a stone’s throw into Canada, one day earlier this month, the United States had a thousand deaths from COVID, Canada had zero. Just two days ago, three days ago, I believe it was, America had 1,200 deaths, Canada had nine. Nine. 
So many lives lost unnecessarily because the President is only worried about the stock market and his reelection. He refused to do what you’re doing right here in this program, social distance, wear a mask, sanitize. You’re protecting your apprentices. He’s not protecting America. 
It’s estimated by the scientists that if we just wore masks nationally, we’d save a hundred thousand lives between now and January 1st. Let me say that again. If we just wore a mask nationally, we’d save a hundred thousand lives between now and January, according to the same study. 
And it was estimated by a great medical school, Columbia medical school, that if the President had just started one week earlier in March than he did, we’d have 36,000 more people sitting at the dinner table tonight, or being able to put your arm around grandpa or grandma tonight. 
And again, in his own words, recorded by Bob Woodward, the President knew back in February that this was an extremely dangerous communicable disease. Think about it. How many people across the Iron Range, how many empty chairs around those dinner tables because of his negligence and selfishness? How many lies said and lives lost? Imagine if he had just, Amy, on the State of the Union that year, spoke up and said, “We got a problem. We can handle it. Here’s what we got to do.” I can’t think of any president who’s ever acted, in my view, so selfishly, about his own reelection instead of a sworn obligation to protect and defend the American people. 
As I said last night in my hometown, I view this campaign as between Scranton and Park Avenue. All Trump sees from Park Avenue is Wall Street. That’s why the only metric of the American prosperity for him is the value of the Dow Jones. Like a lot of you, I spent a lot of my life with guys like Donald Trump looking down on me. Looking down on the people who make a living with their hands. People who take care of our kids, clean our streets. 
Maybe what bothers me most is when he talks about, reportedly talks about from too many sources confirmed by many outlets, when he’s talked about the men and women who join the military and gave full measure for their country as “suckers” and ” losers.” Unless you think it’s made up, remember how he talked about John McCain, a political opponent but a close friend who I did his eulogy. John McCain was no sucker or loser. He was a hero. My son who volunteered and spent a year in Iraq, won the Bronze Star [inaudible 00:11:27], he wasn’t a loser or sucker. He was a proud patriot. 
These are the guys who always thought they were better than me, better than us, because that a lot of money. Guys inherited everything they got and still managed to squander. I have to admit, which I guess is coming out and pretty obvious, particularly relative to Trump, I just have a little bit of a chip on my shoulder about these guys. 
… my shoulder about these guys. Recently, and I probably shouldn’t have said it last night, but I did, recently I read some stories and was asked questions by leading columnists. It went like this. “If you get elected, you’re going to be the first guy in a long time elected president without an Ivy League degree.” Like somehow a kid who went to a state university isn’t qualified to be president of the United States, doesn’t have an Ivy League degree? Let me tell you something. I know how to do the job of being president. It’s pretty clear. No matter how wealthy Donald Trump is, no matter how much he doctors his, if he does, his tax returns, he doesn’t have a clue how to be president. One of the lessons my mother taught me, not a joke, long time ago taught me and my siblings, it’s one that you probably were taught too out here in Minnesota. She said, “Joey, remember nobody’s better than you, but everybody’s your equal. Nobody’s better than you. Everybody’s your equal.” You don’t measure people by the size of their bank accounts. I don’t respect people based on how big the house they live in is. I don’t look down my nose when people are busting their necks just making a limit, nor do any of you. Trump says, by the way, I’m paraphrasing, everyone’s in the stock market. That’s why he cares about the stock market. What the hell is he talking about? People, I grew up in Scranton, Claymont, they don’t have money in stocks. Every penny we made was to pay the bills and take care of the families, putting clothes in the back, and a roof over our head. In the market? 
That’s why I have a different measure in which I judge the health of the American economy. And my measure is Scranton, Duluth, Harmontown, places where I grew up, that so many people I know grew up. I see hard working women and men who are just trying to earn an honest, decent living to take care of their families. I mean, just to have a little bit of confidence, a little bit of confidence, you can just see around the corner. And they don’t have to live literally from paycheck to paycheck. Most do. But hope for a little bit of space. Now the American people have seen these women and men, the essential workers, workers who stock the shelves in the middle of these crisis in the grocery stores, drivers who drove the trucks, delivered the food, farm workers, nurses who risk their lives, in many cases, gave their lives in the middle of this pandemic to save other people. Essential workers. 
And when they walk down the streets and people come out and clap pans and pots together, tell them how much they’re appreciated, that’s not enough. They’re not asking for anything, they’re just asking for a shot. I remind you, given a shot, the American people have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. So it’s about time we start to pay essential workers for the fact that they’re essential. Blinders have been taken off the American people. I think they’re ready. They’re ready to insist that the minimum wage be $15 an hour. They’re ready to insist that people have childcare and access to it. They’re ready to admit and understand the needs that average Americans have. 
That’s why my Build Back Better plan, in fact, my entire campaign is built upon a simple concept. It’s time to reward hard work in America, not wealth. Reward work, not wealth. We don’t have to penalize wealth, it’s the opposite now. Reward wealth and not work. We’re going to have to rebuild an economy in the wake of COVID-19. And as we do, we have an incredible opportunity to make long overdue investments for working families. To make sure the wealthy, the very wealthy and big corporations finally began to pay their fair share. I’m not looking to punish anybody, just pay your fair share. 
It’s time we give hard working families who literally built the country through their skills and their sweat and the blood, like the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, a leg up for once. I’ve a big ambitious plan that bets on the American worker. My plan is going to create millions of good paying jobs building the products and technologies that we need now and in the future. And it starts with a pretty basic idea. When the government spends taxpayers’ money, we should spend that money to buy American products made by American workers in American supply chains to generate American growth and opportunity. My plan would tighten the rules to make buy American a reality. During my first term alone, we’re going to invest $400 billion in federal money that you go out and spend, that I have control over as the president or an administration, to invest and purchase products and materials our country needs to modernize the infrastructure, to replenish critical stockpiles, to enhance our national security. 
I was just going through the apprentice program was one of your carpenters. And you’re showing me how to read blueprints. And I’m a frustrated architect. I just love building. My kids years ago bought me a Lightboard. I have no professional training, but I like and I carry around a graph paper. I’m always making up and designing homes and landscapes. It’s my way out. Some people can paint. I can’t. And you’re showing me the blueprints and how they can change several walls in a particular building to conserve and save energy. And he pointed out what you have to learn to be able to read a blueprint. I pointed out to him that my Buy American plan, he said, “By the way,” not me, this carpenter said, “And by the way, we can kill two birds with one stone.” He didn’t use that phrase. He said, “We can do two things at once.” He said, “We can improve the environment by using less energy to operate this building and create more jobs.” And I said, “I’m going to send you a copy of my plan.” 
I sent a college note exactly what it is. My Buy American Build America plan calls for literally what we started in our administration and couldn’t finish, retrofitting four million buildings in America that are leaking millions of gallons of energy now. In the process, creating the four million jobs for skilled labor. Replacing windows, insulation that works, making sure that the unit is tight, including retrofitting two million homes. All of it done in a prevailing way with union labor, creating hundreds of thousands of union certified jobs. That’s not hyperbole, that’s a fact. That’s how it will happen. And saving millions of barrels of oil in the process, improving our environment. That’s why the IBEW and a lot of other unions support what we’re doing. We’re going to put in 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Why? So we can own, own, own the electric car market. Estimated creating a million new jobs in Michigan and Detroit in automobile industry. Look, we can outcompete anybody, we set our mind to it. My infrastructure plan is going to revitalize American infrastructure so the future is made in America. The president keeps talking about he’s going to invest in infrastructure, right? How many times has he said when you guys were there he had a plan in ’17, his infrastructure plan, it’s coming? Then he had one in ’18, then he had one in ’19, then he has one for ’20. Just like his nonexistent healthcare plan that’s coming next week. He has no plan. 
When I got started, this wasn’t a partisan issue, dealing with infrastructure. Republicans wanted to build solid infrastructure to make us first in the world, now we rank 28th, just like Democrats did. It was totally nonpartisan. And creating thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of good paying jobs. We’re going to invest over time two trillion dollars to build resilient infrastructure. Roads, bridges, ports, right here along with these great Great lakes. 1.5 million new affordable housing units, high speed broadband for every American household. More important than ever as we are educating our children from home because he has no plan how to open our schools. 100 billion dollars to rebuild crumbling schools. How many schools in America do you think there are where you can’t safely drink the water from the water fountain? Where they’re worried about whether or not there is enough ventilation in the school, where there is leaking energy or still has hazardous materials in the walls. It’s ridiculous. 
We should be spending the money to improve those schools and the safety of our children and our teachers. As I said, retrofitting four million buildings and weatherizing two million homes. And the way we do that is with the tax credits that we’re giving them again. All done by certified union labor. Look, I’ll fight for workers and unions at every step requiring all federal infrastructure projects to, one, pay prevailing wage, two, prioritize project labor agreements so collective bargaining is in place before the project starts, employee workers from registered apprenticeships. I won’t water them down like Trump tried to do. Pass the PRO Act to crack down on employers who are trying to block or break unions. And I’ll do it without raising anyone’s taxes if you make less than $400,000 a year. I gave my a word as … You have nothing to worry about if you make less than 400. If you- 
This is why you have nothing to worry about if you make less than 400. If you make more, you’re going to start to pay your fair share. No who makes less than 400 is going to pay a single penny more in taxes under our administration. In fact, tens of millions of middle class families are going to get tax cuts when they need it most, while you’re raising your children, while you’re trying to get affordable healthcare, buying your first home or saving for retirement. 
Almost directly after President Trump passed his tax bill in 2017, almost two-trillion dollars, increased the deficit, he went down to Mar-a-Lago and he said to his guests there, and this is a quote, it’s on record: “You just got a lot richer,” end of quote. He was right. They got a hell of a lot richer. How about the person making 50, 60, or even the family making $120,000 a year? How much did you get? How much richer did you get? It may be the only time he’s told the plain truth, his entire presidency. In 2018, the year after that tax cut passed, 91 corporations in the Fortune 500 paid no income tax. Zero tax. Zero. Making billions of dollars, paid zero tax. I guess you guys got all your taxes eliminated too, right? 
He said he was going to lower the cost of prescription drugs. But guess what, instead of big pharma got billions of dollars in tax cuts, sent they’re manufacturing of those drugs overseas, so they’d be cheaper for them to produce, unconscionably raised the prices for ordinary Americans. How many of you people knew your mother’s, father’s, uncle’s, aunt’s, friend’s had to choose between getting the prescription, not a joke, and putting dinner on the table. Now he says he’s going to try to cut drug prices, like he’s going to have a healthcare plan. All he’s done in this big thing about, he’s calling it drug prices cut, all he’s done, he sent to the HHS, Health and Human Services, he said, “Study the issue.” 
I have a clear plan. I guarantee I’ll lower prices in America for drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which he said he would do. The House and the Senate were ready to do it, and he said he’d veto it if he got it. If you want to participate in the Medicare program, you’ve got to negotiate with Medicare for the price of that drug, which is significantly lower prices. And for any new specialty drugs that don’t have competition that are launched, I’m setting up a review board to recommend a reasonable price based on the board’s evaluation, and that price will not be able to be increased beyond the cost of medical inflation unless they can prove they’ve gone and done some more research and change the nature of the drug. 
Now, astonishingly, astonishingly, and when my staff told me this, I know both the senators knew this, but when they told me this, I said, “He can’t be proposing this.” He now is proposing in this budget another multi-billion dollar tax cut for the very wealthy millionaires and billionaires. Here’s what he wants to do. He wants to lower the capital gains tax down to 15%. To 15%. Every one of you, including the reporters in this room, unless you’re making a lot more than I think you are, every one of you is going to be paying at a higher tax rate than someone making a billion bucks off their investment. You’re going to pay a higher tax rate, because they make their money by investing not by the sweat of your brow. Another tax cut worth billions of dollars. Whose hide do you think that’s going to come out of? Where’s it come from? The deficit is already bonkers. Where do you think it’s going to come out of? It’ll come out of you and the programs and things that help the American people. 
Like I said, it’s about time we start rewarding work, not wealth. Look, I’m not looking to punish anybody, but dammit, it’s about time the super wealthy and corporate America start paying their fair share. That’s all it is. Just pay their fair share so hard work and families can start getting a break on childcare, elder care, buying that first home, and the cost of education beyond high school, being able to get started in life. By the way, all of this is going on while Donald Trump is trying to rip away your healthcare. This whole con: “I got a new healthcare program. I’m going to protect pre-existing conditions.” He’s in the Supreme Court saying get rid of pre-existing conditions. They should not. They shouldn’t be able to stand in the way of you getting insurance because it helps insurance companies. 
And as a gimmick, he’s got a new one. He’s going to end the payroll tax that you pay in social security. Yet the actuary at the social security says if that were to occur, social security will be bankrupt by the middle of 2023. You may get a few more bucks in your paycheck, then go home and tell your mom and dad social security’s about to come to an end. They never liked social security and Medicare to begin with. Look, we can’t let this happen, that social security would run dry by 2023. We’re so much better than this. This United States of America. We have never, ever, ever, ever been unable to do something when we’ve done it together. Never. It’s time to stand up, Democrats and Republicans. I said it last night, and I know my colleagues know sometimes Democrats get mad at this, I’m running as a Democrat, but I’m going to be President of the United States, not President of the Democratic Party. We must unite this country. It’s the only way we can move forward. I believe the American people are ready for it. I believe in half a dozen to a dozen of our Republican colleagues, who’ve been unable and unwilling to have the guts to take him on because he’s so vindictive, with him gone I think they’re ready to work. Not on everything, but an awful lot. It’s time to take the country back, folks. It’s going to start here, today with voting in Minnesota. 
God bless you all and may God protect our troops. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
51,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-climate-change-speech-transcript-september-14,"Joe Biden Climate Change Speech Transcript in Wilmington, Delaware September 14","Good afternoon. Welcome to the Natural History Museum. 
As a nation, we face one of the most difficult moments in our history, in my view. Four historic crises all at the same time. The worst pandemic in a hundred years, it’s already killed nearly 200,000 people and counting. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression has cost tens of millions of American jobs and counting. Emboldened white supremacy unseen since the ’60s and a reckoning on race that’s long overdue. And undeniable acceleration of the punishing reality of climate change on our planet, and our people, on the lives and livelihoods, which I like to talk about now. 
Jill and I continue, as I suspect all of you do, is pray for everyone in California, Oregon, and Washington, and across the West as these devastating wildfires rage one. Just as we hold them in our hearts those who have faced the hurricanes, tropical storms, off our coast of Florida, North Carolina, or like parts of New Orleans that in fact have just finished an emergency evacuation order for Hurricane Sally. 
Floods and droughts across the Midwest. The fury of climate change everywhere. All this year and right now. We stand with our families who have lost everything. The firefighters, the first responders, risking and everything to save others. And the millions of Americans caught between relocating during a pandemic or staying put as ashes and smoke pollute the air they breathe. Just think about that. People aren’t just worried about raging fires, they’re worried about the air they breathe, about the damage to the lungs. Parents are already worried about COVID-19 for their children when they’re indoors and now they’re worried about asthma attacks if their kids are outside. 
Over the past two years, the total damage from wildfires has reached nearly $50 billion in California alone. 50 billion. This year alone, nearly 5 million acres have burned across 10 States, more acreage than the entire state of Connecticut. And it’s only September. California’s wildfire season typically runs through October. Fires are blazing so brightly, smoke reaching so far, NASA satellites can see them 1 million miles away in space. 
The cost of this year’s damage will again be astronomically high, but think of it from the view on the ground. In the smoldering ashes, loved ones lost, along with the photos, the keepsakes, all the memories, spouses and kids praying each night for their firefighter husband, father, wife, and mother. Will they come home? Entire communities destroyed. We have to act as a nation. It shouldn’t be so bad that millions of Americans live in the shadow of an orange sky and they’re left asking, “Is doomsday here?” And I know this feeling of dread and anxiety extends well beyond the fires. We’ve seen record hurricane season costing billions of dollars as well. Last month, Hurricane Laura intensified at a near record rate just before it’s landfall along Louisiana and Gulf Coast. It’s a troubling marker, not for just the increased frequency of the hurricanes, but more powerful and destructive storms. 
They’re causing record damage after record damage to people’s homes, lives, and livelihoods. Before it intensified and hit the Gulf Coast, Laura ravaged Puerto Rico, where three years ago Hurricane Maria, our fellow Americans there are still recovering from its damage and devastation. Think about that reality. Our fellow Americans are still putting things back together from the last big storm as they face the next one. We’ve also seen historic flooding in the Midwest, often compounding the damage delivered by last year’s floods that cost billions of dollars in damage. Many of you traveled through the Midwest with me on that bus tour and you saw it. 
This past spring in Midland, Michigan experienced a flood so devastating with deadly flash flooding over running dams and roadways that is displaced 10,000 residents. It was considered once in a 500 year weather event. But those once in many generation events are now happening every year. The past 10 years were the hottest decade ever recorded. The Arctic is literally melting. Parts are actually on fire. What we’re seeing in America and our communities is connected to all of this. With every bout with nature’s fury caused by our own inaction on climate change, more Americans see and feel the devastation. Whether in the big cities, small towns, on coastlines, or in farm lands, it’s happening everywhere and it’s happening now, and it affects us all. 
Nearly 200 cities, not Republican or Democratic cities, 200 cities are experiencing the longest stretches of deadly heat waves in 50 years. Requires them to help their poor and elderly residents adapt to the extreme heat to simply stay alive, especially in a home without air conditioning, which many don’t have. Our family farmers in the Midwest are facing historic drought. Those follow record floods and hurricanes, sped by wind storms, all this year. The speed of those windstorms has been incredible when you saw it on television or saw it in person. It’s ravaged millions of acres of corn, soybeans, and other crops. Their very livelihoods, which sustain their families, and our economy for generations is now in jeopardy. 
How do they pay their bills this year? What will be left to pass onto their kids? And none of this is happening in a vacuum. Recent studies showed air pollution is linked with increased risk of death from COVID-19. Our economy can’t recover if it can’t build back with more resiliency, more ability to withstand extreme weather, extreme weather that will only come with greater frequency and intensity. The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single solitary one of us, but too often the brunt falls disproportionately on communities of color, exacerbating the need for environmental justice, sorry, there was a bug, speaking of the environment. 
These are interlocking crises of our time. Requires action, not denial. Requires leadership, not scapegoating. It requires the President to meet the threshold duty of the office to care, to care for everyone, to defend us from every attack scene, seen and unseen, always and without exception, because here’s the deal: hurricanes don’t swerve to avoid Red States or Blue States. Wildfires don’t skip towns that voted a certain way. The impacts of climate change don’t pick and choose. That’s because it’s not a partisan phenomenon, it’s science and our response should be the same. Grounded in science. Acting together, all of us, but like with our federal response to COVID-19, a lack of a national strategy on climate, on climate change overall, leaves us with a patchwork of solutions. Matter of fact, it’s been made worse by the changes this administration has made. 
I’m speaking from Delaware. We’re the lowest line state in the nation relative to sea level, where just last week, Delaware state attorney general sued 31 big fossil fuel companies alleging that they knowingly wrecked havoc and damage on climate, our climate. Damage that is plain for everyone to see but the President. And as he flies to California today, we know he has no interest in meeting this moment. We know he won’t listen to the experts or treat this disaster with the urgency it demands, as any President should do during the national emergency. He’s already said he wanted to withhold aid to California to punish the people of California because they didn’t vote for him. This is another crisis. Another crisis he won’t take responsibility for. The West is literally on fire. And he blames the people whose homes and communities are burning. He says, “You got to clean your floors. You got to clean your forest.” 
This is the same President who threw paper towels on the people of Puerto Rico instead of truly helping them recover and rebuild. We know his disdain for our own military leaders and our veterans. Just last year, the Defense Department reported that climate change is a direct threat to more than two thirds of the military’s operationally critical installations. That’s what the military warned him. And this could well could be a conservative estimate. Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have caused these fires and record floods and record hurricanes, but if he gets a second term, these hellish events will continue to become more common, more devastating and more deadly. 
Meanwhile, Donald Trump warns that integration is threatening our suburbs. It’s ridiculous, but you know what is actually threatening our suburbs? Wildfires are burning the suburbs in the West. Floods are wiping out suburban neighborhoods in the Midwest. Hurricanes are imperiling suburban life along our coast. We have four more years of Trump’s climate denial, how many suburbs will be burned in wildfires? How many suburban neighborhoods will have been flooded out? How many suburbs will have been blown away in superstorms? If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if we have more America blaze? If we give a climate denier four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised when more of America is underwater? 
We need a President who respects science, who understands that the damage from climate change is already here. And unless we take urgent action, it will soon be more catastrophic. A President who recognizes, understands, and cares that Americans are dying, which makes President Trump’s climate denialism, his disdain for science and facts, all the more unconscionable. Once again, he fails the most basic duty to a nation. He fails to protect us from the pandemic, from an economic free fall, from racial unrest, from the ravages of climate change. It’s clear that we’re not safe in Donald Trump’s America. This is Donald Trump’s America. He’s in charge. What he doesn’t get is that even in a crisis, there’s nothing beyond the capacity of the American people when we stand up and act together. And while so many of you are hurting right now, I want you to know that if you give me the honor of serving as your President, we can, and we will meet this moment with urgency and purpose. We can, and we will solve the climate crisis, and we’ll build back better than we were before. 
When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, he thinks hoax. When I think about it, I think jobs. Good paying union jobs to put Americans to work, building a stronger, more climate resilient nation. A nation modernized. We have modernized water and transportation systems. An energy infrastructure to withstand the impacts of extreme weather and changing climate. When Donald Trump thinks about renewable energy, he sees windmills somehow as causing cancer. I see American manufacturing, American workers racing to lead the global market. I see farmers making agriculture the first in the world to achieve net zero emissions. And in the process, gaining new sources of income. Donald Trump’s thinks about LED light bulbs, he says he doesn’t like them because the lights are no good. They always make him look orange. 
I see small businesses and master electricians designing and installing award-winning energy conservation measures, rebuilding buildings across the country. It’s going to reduce electrical consumption and save businesses hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in energy costs. While he turns against our allies, I’ll bring us back into the Paris Agreement. I’ll put us back in the business of leading the world on climate change, and I’ll challenge every other country to up the ante on climate commitments. 
Where he reverses the Obama Biden fuel efficiency standards, he picks big oil. He picks big oil companies over American workers, even when the automobile industry agreed. I don’t want to bring the standards back, I’ll set new ambitious ones that our workers are ready to meet. I’ll also see American workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations along our newly engaged infrastructure programs and highways, all across the country. 
I see American consumers switching to electric vehicles through rebates and initiatives. Not only that, the United States owns and maintains and enormous fleet of vehicles. And we’re going to harness the purchasing power of our Federal Government to make sure we’re buying electric vehicles that are made and sourced by union workers right here in the United States of America. And together, this will mean more than a million new jobs in the American auto industry. 
And we’ll do another big thing, we’ll put us on a path to achieving a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 that no future President can come along and turn back. Transforming the electrical sector power to produce power without carbon pollution will be the greatest spur to job creation and economic competitiveness in the 21st century, not to mention the positive benefits to our health and our environment. We need to get to work right away. We’ll need scientists at the National Labs and Land-grant universities, historic black colleges and universities, to improve and innovate technologies needed to generate, store, and transmit this clean electric. 
We need engineers to design and workers to manufacture these new products. We’ll need iron workers and welders to install them. We’ll need to become the world’s largest exporter of these technologies, creating even more jobs sourced in America. We know how to do this. The Obama-Biden administration rescue the auto industry and help them retool. We made solar energy cost competitive with traditional energy and weatherized more than a million homes, which is just the beginning if we get reelected. And We’ll do it again, bigger and faster and better than before. 
We’ll also build 1.5 million new energy efficient homes and public housing units that will benefit our communities in three times over by eliminating the affordable housing crisis, by increasing energy efficiency, and by reducing the racial wealth gap linked to home ownership. There are thousands of oil and natural gas wells that oil companies and gas companies have abandoned, many of what you’re leaking toxins. We can 250,000 jobs now by just plugging those wells right away. Good union jobs for energy workers. 
This will help sustain communities and protect them from the environmental damage as well, whilst creating new markets for our family farmers and ranchers. We’ll launch a new, modern Civilian Climate Corp to heal our public lands and make us much less vulnerable to wildfires and floods. I believe that every American has a fundamental right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. I know that we haven’t fulfilled that right yet. That’s true of the millions families struggling with the smoke created devastation of the wildfires right now, but it’s also been true for a generation or more in places like Cancer Alley in Louisiana, or right here in Delaware, along the Route 9 Carter, right here in Delaware, fulfilling this basic obligation to all Americans, especially in low income, white, black, Brown, and Native American communities who too often don’t have the clean air and the clean water. 
It’s not going to be easy, but it’s necessary. I’m committing to get it done. These aren’t pie in the sky dreams. These are concrete, actionable problems that create American jobs, mitigate climate change, and put our nation on the road to net zero emissions by no later than 2050. Some say we can’t afford to fix this, but here’s the thing, look around at the crushing consequences of the extreme weather events I’ve been describing. We’ve already been paying for it. So we have a choice. We can invest in our infrastructure to make it stronger, more resilient, improving the health of Americans and creating millions of good paying jobs while at the same time, tackling the root causes of climate change, or we can continue down the path Donald Trump has us on. A path of indifference, costing tens of billions of dollars to rebuild when the human cost, the lives and the livelihoods and the homes and the communities destroyed, are immeasurable. 
We have a choice. We can commit to doing this together because we know that climate change is the existential challenge that’s going to determine our future as a country for our children, our grandchildren, and our great grandchildren, or we can do it Donald Trump’s way. Ignore the facts, deny reality, which amounts to a full surrender and a failure to lead. It’s backward looking politics that’s going to harm the environment, make communities less healthy, and hold back economic progress while other countries race ahead. And it’s a mindset that doesn’t have any faith in the capacity of the American people to compete, to innovate, and to win. 
Like the pandemic, dealing with climate change is a global crisis. And that requires American leadership. It requires a President for all Americans. So as the fires rage out West on this day, our prayers remain with everyone under the ash. I know it’s hard to see the sun rise, believing today will be a better day than yesterday. Americans face this historic inflection point. A time of real peril, but also a time of extraordinary possibilities. I’m confident. I know we can do this. We will do this. This is the United States of America. We’ve seen the light through the dark smoke. We never give up. Always without exception, every time, we succeed when we try. 
May God bless our firefighters and keep them safe, and our first responders. May God protect our troops. Thank you very much. I’m anxious to hear what the President had to say. Thank you."
52,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-speech-transcript-warren-michigan-september-9,"Joe Biden Speech Transcript Warren, Michigan September 9","It’s great to be here in Michigan and with the United auto workers. As they say, in parts of my state, I got brung up on General Motors. My father ran a General Motors agency. He didn’t own it, but he ran it and cars or cars or cars. By the way, I still have my ’67 Corvette that’s new. It was new. I still keep that, but I got to tell you, I’m waiting for that electric one you just made that goes 210 miles an hour, but that’s a different story. 
Look, earlier this week and the reason we’re a little bit late here, we found as I was getting off the plane, the press asked me a legitimate question that I did not have the background on because it occurred on the plane. Earlier this week, we celebrated Labor Day. And here in the heart of the American automobile industry, we never forget everything that we owe the unions. And unions, as you’ve heard me say many times, built this country. Unions built the economy. The economic engine has driven American manufacturing dynamism. And literally in the case of the auto workers, you’re the ones that did it. 
So I want to thank you again, UAW region one, for hosting me today. And it’s great to see Senator Stabenow. My good friend, Debbie Stabenow. Got a chance to spend a little time with the governor, but Senator Stabenow and I worked together on an awful lot of matters over the years in the United States Senate. She was a great partner to me when I was vice president and we worked in lockstep to get the people in Michigan back on their feet. We’re joined by one of the best and brightest and hardest working governors around, my friend, Gretchen Whitmer. 
And if you’re wondering what responsible strong executive leadership looks like in COVID-19, just look at this executive right here. Governor, you’ve done an incredible job steering the people of Michigan through a turbulent time. Much of it is brought on by Donald Trump’s lack of leadership. You’ve been rock solid, governor. You’ve listened to the experts and you’ve led with science and you put the needs of the people, who are hurting first, helping them get through this crisis. 
Meanwhile, on the day that we hit 190,000 dead in the United States, because of COVID-19, we just learned from the Washington Post columnist Bob Woodward that the president of the United States has admitted on tape in February he knew about COVID-19 that had passed through the air. He knew how deadly it was. It was much more deadly than the flu. He knew and purposely played it down. Worse, he lied to the American people. 
He knowingly and willingly lied about the threaded pose to the country for months. He had the information. He knew how dangerous it was. Now, while this deadly disease ripped through our nation, he failed to do his job on purpose. It was a life and death betrayal of the American people. Experts say that if he had acted just one week sooner, 36,000 people would have been saved. If he acted two weeks sooner, back in March, 54,000 lives would have been spared in March and April alone. His failure has not only costs lives. He sent our economy in a tailspin. It costs millions more in American livelihoods. This is a recession created by Donald Trump’s negligence. And he is unfit for this job as a consequence of it. How many schools aren’t open right now? How many kids are starting a new school year the same way they ended the last one at home? 
How many parents feel abandoned and overwhelmed? How many frontline workers are exhausted and pushed to the limits? And how many families are missing loved ones at their dinner table tonight because of his failures? It’s beyond despicable. It’s a dereliction of duty. It’s a disgrace. We’re going to hear a lot more about this. I’m sure, not just from me, but from the news media and a lot of others, but I want to ask you one simple question. What’s the value of a promise? What’s it worth? What’s the worth of a woman or man’s word, of a president’s word, if it’s not matched with action? 
In 2016, then candidate Trump came here to Warren just a few days before the election. Here’s what he said. He said, “If I’m elected, you won’t lose one plant. You have plants coming into this country. You’re going to have jobs again. You won’t lose one plant. I promise you. I promise you.” That’s what he said. Donald Trump makes a lot of promises. He promised that he alone could stop the off shoring of jobs. He promised he bring back jobs, stop companies from leaving. He could do what, “Nobody else could do it, but him.” Nut he promised it has administration would enforce every last buying American provision on behalf of the American people. And what makes his wild claims and hopes, he now hopes we don’t notice what he said or won’t remember. And when he does follow through or doesn’t do with follow through the exact opposite, he’s hoping we just have poor memories. 
He doesn’t give us much credit, but the American people are smart, honest, decent, and they’re hard working. And we expect our president to be straight with us, to do what he or she says they’re going to do. So let’s look at the reality of Donald Trump’s economy and what exactly his promise to the American people and workers are worth. He’s on track to be the first president since Herbert Hoover in the Great Depression to see the number of jobs in our economy go down, not up while being president. Our economy’s down 4.7 million jobs since he took office, 4.7. 
Even before President Trump’s failed response to COVID-19 crashed through our economy, his reckless and chaotic trade policy had thrown American manufacturing into recession. It was already contracting in 2019, even when COVID-19 hit, before it hit. Trump was creating an average of 500,000 jobs fewer per year than the last three years when President Obama and I were an office. When the GM transmission plant here in Warren close last year, I bet the workers around weren’t all that comforted by Trump’s empty promises. 
Under Donald Trump, Michigan lost auto jobs, even before COVID did. And what about off shoring? Has Trump delivered on stopping companies from shipping jobs overseas, American jobs? You already know the answer. Of course not. The rate of offshoring by federal contractors, there are people that get federal dollars from the federal government to do things. The off shoring, big companies being paid by US Taxpayers has doubled, doubled under Trump. Those federal contracts with your tax dollars. They’ve doubled the number that had been off shored. 
He invited companies to the White House to make what he called the pledge to American workers. He couldn’t even keep those firms from outsourcing. Many were given lucrative federal contracts, but then some of them turned around and shipped 7,000 jobs overseas. Under President Trump, US trade deficit has grown. It’s hit an all time high. Let me say that again. US trade deficit is at an all time high under Trump in the last three years. 
President Trump’s answered all this as the same as he’s answered everything. Corporate tax giveaways that actually ward off shoring. You heard me right. Giveaways that reward offshoring. If you offshore, you get more tax breaks. His 2017 tax bill slashed taxes on companies that sent production and jobs overseas. Those corporations then make huge profits by shipping these foreign made products back to the United States to sell to American consumers. And no industry has taken a greater advantage of Trump’s offshoring tax loopholes than the pharmaceutical industry. 
Big pharma lobbied Trump for a handout. That’s exactly what they got from him. US pharma is building factories overseas instead of the United States, skipping out on having to pay US taxes and then sending those same foreign made drugs back to American consumers, all while raising their prices on prescription drugs that union families and working people have to rely on. And in the process by the way, he’s trying to do away with all healthcare in America. 
During a pandemic, we’re seeing not only the inequity of this policy, but the enormous vulnerability that this creates for our own health security. And our security requires us to have supply chains of the necessary drugs based here, not overseas. Not overseas in times of crisis. 
And what about Trump’s commitment to buy American? Like the rest of President Trump’s promise it has nothing to do with reality. It’s all a bunch of hot air. In fact, contracts awarded by US governments to foreign companies using American tax dollars went up 30% since he’s been president. So to recap, one, Trump hasn’t stopped companies from closing plants and sending jobs overseas. Two, he’s rewarded companies that have cut jobs and failed to invest here at home with billions of dollars in tax breaks. And three, he’s awarding more and more federal contracts to foreign companies. President Trump has broken just about every promise he’s ever made to the American worker. And he’s failed. He’s failed our economy and our country. 
But look, would you really expect anything different from this guy? From someone who called those of you and those who are serving in uniform, who have given their lives to the country losers and suckers? Let me tell you something. My son Beau is an assistant US attorney. He volunteered to go to Kosovo to help them set up a government in the middle of the war. I know I’m being proud here, but he’s the only foreigner has a monument that they raised and built in service to him, thanking him for what he did. My son also then as attorney general volunteered to go to Iraq for one year. He wasn’t a loser or a sucker. No one who served this nation has been a loser or a sucker. They’re all heroes. Or would you expect anything different than someone who could stand next to a father of a fallen soldier and say at a cemetery and say, “I don’t get it. What was in it for them?” What was in it for them? 
Donald Trump does understand what it means to serve something bigger than yourself. He doesn’t understand duty, honor, country. He lives by a different code. Lies, selfishness, greed. Yes, Donald Trump and I have a pretty different philosophy when it comes to giving our word. Mine means something. When I tell the American people I’m going to do something, I follow through. Here in Michigan, you know that’s true. 
When Barack and I took office back in 2009, the economy was crashing. We inherited an economy in free fall. And millions of Americans, including so many right here in Michigan, lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings. With the help of Debbie breaking her neck here, President Obama and I worked hard. He put me in charge of the Recovery Act. I spent a lot of time here in Michigan and Detroit, working with you and Senator Stabenow, and thinking every single day about the folks on the factory line, busting their necks, just trying to put food on the table. 
A lot of folks were all ready to count Detroit out as well as the auto American industry to count it out. But I knew what Debbie knew. I’ve known always. It’s never a good bet to bet against the American worker. So when we promise to stand with the American auto industry, we delivered. We didn’t do it to help wealthy investors or pad bonus checks for CEOs, we did it to save an iconic American industry, a testament to the skills and ingenuity of American manufacturing. And the jobs of hundreds of thousands of American workers and the lifeblood of communities all across the Midwest, and used to be in my state of Delaware as well. When Detroit declared bankruptcy, I was right here working alongside the city leaders to get the lights turned back on to revitalize the future of Detroit. 
Well, nearly 20,000 auto manufacturing jobs have been lost in Michigan under Trump. Nearly 80,000 were created during the Obama Biden administration. I’ve got long history. I’m not just talking about what I’m going to do, but delivering results for Michiganders. And now, we need to do it again. We need to do the hard work, not only to recover, but to build the economy back for the future once more. That’s why my build back better agenda, that’s what it’s all about. Starts right here with you in the union halls, all across America. Back in July, I made the first plank in my agenda a plan to modernize American manufacturing and technology to ensure that the future is made in America, by all of you. And today, I’m announcing some additional steps to make this plank even stronger. 
First, we’re going to impose a tax penalty on companies that avoid paying US taxes by off shoring jobs and manufacturing, only to sell those goods back to the American consumer. If your big corporate strategy is to boost your shareholders profits, your CEOs’ bonuses by moving jobs out, well, we’re going to make sure you not only pay full US taxes on those profits, but we’re going to guarantee. We’re going to add a 10% off shoring penalty surge tax to your bill. No more deductions for writing off expenses for the cost of sending jobs overseas, which is a big deal that could be done here at home by qualified American workers. I’m not looking to punish American business, but there’s a better way. Make it in Michigan, make it in America, invest in our communities and the workers in places like Warren. That’s what this is about. 
UAW workers, steel workers, IBW workers. You’re the best craftsmen and women in the world. And you’re right here. If you’re ready to make it in America, then just like there are consequences for off showing, there will be rewards and incentives for creating good paying jobs here at home. Today, I’m announcing my new Made in America tax credit, a 10% advanceable tax credit for companies that invest in the United States and American workers, to help accelerate the recovery under our build back better agenda. 
So if your company revitalizes a closing facility here in the United States, like the transmission plant that got closed last year, we’ll take care of 10% of the investment that company makes to reopen it. If you retool a manufacturing facility to make it more competitive, for example, by shifting to help build a new fleet of clean American vehicles made by UAW members, we’ll make sure that’s more than affordable for you. We’re going to make sure you’ll get a tax credit. If you reshore jobs that have previously been sent overseas, expand your operations in the United States or increase wages for manufacturing jobs will make an even smarter strategic decision for your company because we will make sure you get a tax credit. 
These two steps on top of my plans to close each and every one of the Trump loopholes that he created in 2017 with his tax cut to reward companies with big tax breaks for off shoring. That’s going to end. If you’re going to want to build things here in the United States, because under our administration, the Biden Harris Administration, is going to deliver on the promise to buy American. It’s been a law for almost a century, but we’ve never lived up to it. The idea is simple. 
Today, the US government spends about $600 billion of taxpayer’s money on federal contracts annually. And that money should go to support American jobs and American businesses. But President Trump has only ever treated it like it was a weak suggestion. Agencies of the federal government can waive the requirements, explanations that Trump doesn’t bother even kick back on. We’re going to change that when I’m president. 
In my first week, I’ll sign a series of executive actions to make sure we enforce by America and direct the full purchasing power of the federal government to fulfill his promise, starting by closing those waiver loopholes immediately. And I promise you, I’ll use the full power of the Defense Production Act to enforce buy American and tighten the rules for public infrastructure projects, roads, bridges, canals, airports. And I’m going to crack down on companies that label products as made in America, even if they’re coming from China or elsewhere. We found out that on Trump’s watch a company selling deployment bags to active duty troops being deployed falsely claimed this product was made in America. When in fact, it was really made mostly in China. Trump didn’t do anything to respond. I’m not going to let that happen on my watch. We’re going to have an office at the White House dedicated to making sure everyone is playing by the same made in America rules. 
And one more thing, when I say we’re going to use the purchasing power of the federal government to reinvigorate domestic manufacturing, I mean. We’re going to do that with the American automobile industry as well. United States government owns and maintains an enormous fleet of vehicles. We’re going to convert those government vehicles into electric vehicles, made in America, sourced right here in the United States of America. With the government providing the demand and support to retool factories that are suggesting they’re struggling to compete, the United States automobile industry will set up expanding the capacity in the United States, not China, to lead the world in clean energy vehicles. I can’t wait to get, I said, behind that all electric Corvette that goes 210 miles an hour. Y’all think I’m kidding. I mean it. Last year, that converted Corvette set a speed record of 210.2 miles per hour, electric vehicle. So don’t tell me we don’t still make the best cars right here in the United States of America, and trucks. We’re going to make it easy for American consumers to switch to electric vehicles. 
We’re going to build on all the new infrastructure we’re going to build on highways. We’re going to build a network of 500,000 charging stations across America, providing prevailing wage jobs for the IBW and other craftsmen all across the country. And by offering rebates and incentives to swap older fuel efficient vehicles for new clean American made models, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. And together, this will mean, listen to me now, 1 million new jobs in the American automobile industry, 1 million. With supply chain, as well as the associated infrastructure, we can do this. We can do this. We can revitalize our industrial base as the heart of the American middle class. 
Think about the worker in Warren who when the transmission plant closed, he told a reporter and I’m quoting him, “Getting a good GM job 23 years ago for me was like winning the lottery,” he said. “I was trying to start a family. I was able to buy a house. I went to Disney world, all that.” Think about that. A job that felt like winning a lottery because it opened the door to a life that you wanted for yourself, because it gave you dignity, allowed you to provide for your family. Getting a good job in 2020, right here in America, shouldn’t be a lottery. It should be an absolute expectation for everyone. 
I don’t accept the defeatist view that the forces of automation and globalization mean we can’t keep good paying union jobs here in America and create more of them. I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. We have the most qualified workers in the world. American manufacturing, is the old expression you heard your grandpop say or your grandmother, was the arsenal of democracy in World War II. Well, guess what? It’s going to be part of the engine of American prosperity now in 2021, and we’re going to make it happen with American grit, American determination, and American union workers. 
Look, folks. That’s my promise to you. And keep in mind, back in the 30s, they set up the law relating to unions. It said that not you could have a union, it said the government should encourage unions to increase [inaudible 00:25:10]. You’re going to have the best, most friendly union president in history of the United States of America, when I’m in the White House. 
I want to thank you all, for all you do. Don’t give up hope. Don’t give up hope. We can come back. We can come back stronger than we were before. I want to thank you all. I carry with me… I don’t have it. I gave it to my staff. I carry with me in my pocket… Do I have that around, anyone? Where’s my staff? I gave it away. Anyway, I carry a schedule in my pocket that lists every single day the number of troops lost in Afghanistan and Iraq. The number wounded. This is my schedule. The back of the schedule is always a black box. You can’t really see it. The press may be able to. It says daily US updates. Troops died in Iraq and Afghanistan, 6,922, not over 6,000, 6,922, is every one of those women and men left behind. An entire group of people relied on them. 
US troops wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan, 53,188. Not over 53,000. US COVID infected in America, 6,344,700. US COVID deaths, 189,506. Military COVID infected, 118,984. Military COVID deaths, 6,114. Folks, every one of these lives matter. Every one of these lives left somebody behind grieving. We can’t ever forget them, ever, ever forget them. Thank you all. God bless you. And may God protect our troops. Thank you."
53,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-pittsburgh-speech-transcript-august-31,Joe Biden Pittsburgh Speech Transcript August 31,"I want to thank Carnegie Mellon for providing this space and all the promise it holds for future jobs in the high tech world. In recent days, we’ve had a lot of talk about who’s going where and how I’ve decided to come to Pittsburgh to talk a little bit about what’s going on right now. In the early days of World War II, Franklin Roosevelt told the country, and I quote, “The news is going to get worse and worse before it gets better and better. And the American people deserve to have it straight from the shoulder.” Straight from the shoulder. The job of a president is to tell it straight from the shoulder, tell the truth, to be candid, to face facts, to lead, not to insight. That’s why I’m speaking to you today. The incumbant president is incapable of telling us the truth, incapable of facing the facts and incapable of healing. He doesn’t want to shed light, he wants to generate heat and he’s stroking violence in our cities. 
This is a tragic fact of the matter, how he’s dealing with this perilous hour in our nation. And now we have to stand against violence in every form it takes. Violence we’ve seen again and again and again, of unwarranted police shooting, excessive force, seven bullets in the back of Jacob Blake. Knee on the neck of George Floyd, killing of Breonna Taylor in her own apartment, violence of extremists and opportunists, right wing militias… And to derail any hope and support for progress, the senseless violence of looting and burning and destruction of property. I want to make it absolutely clear, so I’m going to be very clear about all of this, rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It’s lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted. Violence will not bring change, it will only bring destruction. It’s wrong in every way. It divides instead of unites, destroys businesses, only hurts the working families that serve the community. It makes things worse across the board, not better. 
It’s not what Dr. King or John Lewis taught and it must end. Fires are burning and we have a president who fans the flames rather than fighting the flames. But we must not burn, we have to build. This president, long ago, forfeited any moral leadership in this country. He can’t stop the violence because for years he’s fomented it. He may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong. But his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows how weak he is. Does anyone believe there’ll be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected? 
We need justice in America. We need safety in America. We’re facing multiple crises. Crises that under Donald Trump have kept multiplying. COVID, economic devastation, unwarranted police violence, [inaudible 00:03:48] white nationalists, a reckoning on race, declining faith in the birth of the right American future. There’s no reason why we can’t just do so much more than we’re doing. The common threat, the incumbent president who makes things worse, not better, an incumbent president who sows chaos rather than providing order. An incumbent president who fails in the basic duty of the job, which is to advance the truth that all of us know, that we’re all born with the right to life, Liberty, and pursuit of happiness. That’s right. All of us, the moms and dads in Scranton, where I grew up, who have worked and scraped for everything they’ve ever gotten in life. 
The auto worker in Michigan, who still makes the best automobile in the world, single mom in Ohio, working three jobs just to stay afloat who’ll do anything for her child. Retired veteran in Florida who gave everything he had to this country. And now just wants us to honor the promises made to him. [inaudible 00:04:58] salesperson who just lost their job. A store closing after 194 years in business. Nurses and doctors in Wisconsin who’ve seen so much sickness, so much death in the past six months. And they wonder how much more can they take, but still they muster up the courage to take care of those patients in this pandemic while risking their own lives. Researchers in Minnesota who woke up this morning determined to find a breakthrough in treating cancer and who’ll do the same thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after, because she’ll never give up. White, Black, Latino, Asian American, Native Americans, everybody, I’m in this campaign for you. No matter your color, no matter your zip code, no matter your politics. 
When I think of the presidency, I don’t think about myself. It isn’t about my brand. It’s about you, the American people. We can do better and we have to do better. I promise you this. We will do better. The road back begins now in this campaign. You know me, you know my heart, you know my story, my family story. Ask yourself, do I look like a radical socialist with a soft spot for rioters? Really? I want a safe America, safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. Let me be crystal clear, safe from four more years of Donald Trump. I look at this violence and I see lives and communities and the dreams of small businesses being destroyed and the opportunity for real progress on issues of race and police reform and justice being put to the test. Donald Trump looks at this violence and he sees a political lifeline. Having failed to protect this nation from the virus that has killed more than 180,000 Americans so far, Trump posts an all caps tweet, screaming, “Law and order,” to save his campaign. 
One of his closest political advisers in the White House doesn’t even bother to speak in code, just comes out and she says it. “The more chaos, violence, the better it is for Trump’s reelection.” Just think about that. This is a sitting president of the United States of America. He’s supposed to be protecting this country, but instead he’s rooting for chaos and violence. The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now he’s trying to scare America. Since Donald Trump and Mike Prince can’t run on their record that has seen more American death to a virus, this virus, then the nation suffered in every war since Korea combined, since they can’t run on their economy that has seen more people lose their jobs than any time since the Great Depression, since they can’t run on a simple proposition of sending our children safely back to school, since they have no agenda or vision for a second term, Trump and Pence are running on this. 
And I find it fascinating. “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.” And what’s their proof? The violence we’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America. These are not images of some imagined Joe Biden America in the future. These are images of Donald Trump’s America today. He keeps telling you if only he was president, it wouldn’t happen. If he was president. He keeps telling us that he was president you’d feel safe. Well he is president. Whether he knows it or not, and it is happening, it’s getting worse. And you know why? Because Donald Trump adds fuel to every fire because he refuses to even acknowledge that there’s a racial justice problem in America because he won’t stand up to any form of violence. He’s got no problem with right-wing militia, white supremacists, and vigilantes with assault weapons often better armed than the police. Often in the middle of the violence at the protestors and aiming it there. And because tens of millions of Americans simply don’t trust this president to respect their rights, to hear their concerns or to protect them. It doesn’t have to be this way. 
When President Obama and I were in the White House, we had to defend federal property. We did it. We didn’t see it. You didn’t see us whipping up fears around the deployment of secret federal troops. We just did our job and the federal property was protected. When president Obama and I were in office, we didn’t look at cities as Democratic or Republican run. These are American cities. But Trump doesn’t seem himself as president for all of America. Frankly, I believe if I were president today, the country would be safer and we’d be seeing a lot less violence, and here’s why. I have said we must address the issue of racial injustice. I’ve personally spoken to George Floyd’s family, and to Jacob Blake’s family. I know their pain. And so do you. I know the justice they seek and so do you. They’ve told us, “None of this violence respects or honors George or Jacob.” I believe it can bring these folks fighting for racial justice to the table. 
I’ve worked with police in this country for many years. I know most cops are good, decent people. I know how they risk their lives every time they put that shield on and go out the door. I’m confident I can bring the police to the table as well. I’d make sure every mayor and governor had the support they needed from the federal government. But I wouldn’t be looking to use the United States military against our own people. If I were president, my language would be less divisive, I’d be looking to lower the temperature in this country, not raise it. I’d be looking to unite the nation. But look, if Donald Trump wants to ask the question, “Who will keep you safer as president?” Let’s answer that question. First, some simple facts. When I was vice president, violent crime fell 15% in this country. We did it without chaos and disorder. 
And yes, we did it with democratic mayors in most of the major cities in this country. The murder right now is up 26% across the nation this year under Donald Trump. Do you really feel safer under Donald Trump? COVID has taken this year, just since the outbreak, has taken more than 100… Look, the lives, when you think about it, more lives this year than any other year for the past 100 years. More than 180,000 lives in just six months, an average of 1,000 people dying every day in the month of August. Do you really feel safe under Donald Trump? Mr. Trump, you want to talk about fear? Do you know what people are afraid of in America? Afraid they’re going to get COVID. They’re afraid they’re going to get sick and die. And that is in no small part because of you. We’re now on track to more than 200,000 deaths in this country due to COVID. More than 100,000 seniors have lost their lives to the virus. 
More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol. Nearly one in six small businesses have closed in this country today. Do oyu really feel safer under Trump? What about Trump’s plan to destroy the Affordable Care Act, and with it, the protections for preexisting conditions that impacts more than 100 million Americans? Does that make you feel safer? Or how about Trump’s plan to defund social security? The social security administration’s chief actuary just released a report saying that if a plan like the one Trump is proposing goes into effect, the social security trust fund would be, and I quote, “Permanently depleted by the middle of calendar year 2023, with no ability to pay benefits thereafter.” To put it plainly, Trump’s plan with wipe out social security period. Do you feel safer and more secure now? The fear that reigns under this president doesn’t stop at our shores. The Kremlin has put bounties on the heads of American soldiers. 
And instead of telling Vladimir Putin that there’d be no putting up with this, that there’d be a heavy price to pay if they dare touch an American soldier, this president doesn’t even bring up the subject in his multiple phone calls with Putin. It’s been reported that Russian forces just attacked American troops in Syria, injuring our service members. Did you hear the president say a single word? Did he lift one finger? Never before has an American president played such a subservient role to a Russian leader. It’s not only dangerous, it’s humiliating and embarrassing for the rest of the world to see, it weakens us. Not even American troops can feel safer under Trump. Donald Trump’s role as a bystander in his own presidency extends to the economic plan and pain. The plan he doesn’t have and the pain being felt by millions of Americans. He said this week, and I quote, “You better vote for me, or you’re going to have the greatest depression you’ve ever seen.” Does he not understand and see the tens of millions of people who’ve had to file for unemployment this year so far? 
The people who won’t be able to make next month’s rent payment? The people who lost wages or the cost of groceries have gone up dramatically? President Obama and I stopped a depression in 2009. We took a bad economy that was falling and turned it around. Trump took a good economy and drove it back into the ditch. Through his failure to get COVID under control, his failure to pull together the leaders in Congress, his failure to deliver real relief to working people, has made our country’s economic situation so much worse, so much worse than it had to be. We talk about safety and security. We should talk about basic security of being able to look your child in the eye and tell them, “Everything’s going to be okay. Don’t worry, honey. We’re not going to lose our home. We’re going to be able to put food on the table. It’s going to be okay.” 
It’s the job of the president. I’ve laid out an agenda for economic recovery that will restore a sense of security for working families. We won’t just build things back the way they were before. We’re going to build them back better with good paying jobs. Building our nation’s roads, bridges, solar rays, windmills with investments in our healthcare and childcare workers so they get the pay and dignity they deserve while easing the financial burdens on millions of families with a clean energy strategy that has a place for the energy workers right here in Western Pennsylvania. I am not banning fracking. Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me, the future, that’s what this is all about. We hear Donald Trump’s self centered rants and riffs, but the voice of Americans should be heard. And one you should listen to is Julia Jackson, the mother of Jacob Blake. Hers is a voice of courage, character and wisdom. 
Looking at the damage that has been done in her city, she said, “The violence and destruction doesn’t reflect my son or my family.” These are the words of a mom, a mother whose son had just been shot seven times in front of his children, badly injured, paralyzed, perhaps permanently. And even as she seeks justice for her son, she’s pleading for an end to the violence and for this nation to heal. She said she was praying for her son. Then she said something to me that that surprised me. She said she was praying for all police officers. She said was already been praying for America even before her son was shot. She’s publicly asked all of us to examine our hearts, citizens, elected officials, the police, all of us. And then she said, this. “We need healing. More than anything, that’s what we need to do as a nation. We need to heal.” 
Our current president wants you to live in fear, he advertises himself as a figure of order. He isn’t, and he’s not been part of the solution thus far. He’s part of the problem. The problem, I, as president, will give you my all resolve to stop. I’ll deal with the virus, I’ll deal with the economic crisis, and I’ll work to bring a quality and opportunity to everyone. We’ve arrived at a moment in this campaign, we all know, including the press in front of me, knew we’d get to. The moment when Donald Trump would be so desperate, he’d do anything to hold onto power. Donald Trump has been a toxic presence in our nation for four years. Poisoning how we talk to one another, poisoning how we treat one another, poisoning the values this nation has always held dear, poisoning our very democracy. Now, in just a little over 60 days, we have a decision to make. Will we rid ourselves of this toxin or will we make it a permanent part of our nation’s character? 
As Americans, I’m confident we believe in honesty and decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, giving everyone a fair shot, leaving no one behind, giving hate no safe harbor, and demonizing no one. We, up to now, always recognize there’s something bigger than ourselves, that’s what we’re about. Trump doesn’t seem to believe in any of that. Look, I’ve said it before and I’ll keep saying it, America is an idea. It’s the most powerful idea in the history of the world. And I believe it beats in the hearts of the people of this country. All men and women are created equal and they deserve to be treated equally. 
Trump has sought to remake this nation in his image. Selfish, angry, dark, and divisive. This is not who we are. At her best, america’s always been, and if I have anything to do it, it will be again, generous, confident, an optimistic nation full of hope and resolve. Donald Trump is determined to instill fear in America. That’s what his entire campaign for the president has come down to, fear. But I believe Americans are stronger than that. I believe we’ll be guided by the words of Pope John Paul II, words drawn from the scriptures. Be not afraid, be not afraid. Fear never builds the future, but hope does. And building the future is what America does, what we’ve always done. In fact, it’s what we have done best and continue to do best. This is the United States of America. There’s not a single thing beyond our capacity when we decide to do it together. So let’s get together. I want to thank you all. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops."
55,https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-and-kamala-harris-speech-transcript-august-12-first-campaign-event-as-running-mates,Joe Biden and Kamala Harris Speech Transcript August 12: First Campaign Event as Running Mates,"Please welcome Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Kamala Harris. 
Hello hello. Thanks for being here. I wish we were able to talk to the folks outside but we’re keeping our social distancing and playing by the rules. Good afternoon everyone. To me and to Kamala, this is an exciting day. It’s a great day for our campaign and it’s a great day for America in my view. Over the past several weeks I have had the incredible privilege of meeting and spending a good deal of time with a group of talented women leaders, all of whom are qualified to be president. With each one, the more I learned about them, the more I talked to them, the more impressed I was even though I knew them before. I want to thank each and every one of them for being part of this process and I look forward to working with them as we rebuild this country to get elected and once we are elected God willing. 
I approached this with a seriousness of purpose and of mind because this is a serious moment for our nation. We’re at one of those inflection points, you’ve heard me say that before, in our history. A life-changing election for this nation and the choice, the choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time and I had a great choice. Great opportunities. I had a great choice but I have no doubt that I picked the right person to join me as the next Vice President of the United States of America and that’s Senator Kamala Harris. You know, it seems Americans all across this nation, at least at the outset here agree with me. Yesterday we had our best grassroots fundraising day of the campaign, more than double our previous record, and in doing so, we set a single day record for online political fundraising and I think I know why. So I hope that you’ll join us as well, those of you listening today. Go to joebiden.com today, $5.00, $10.00, whatever. 
Kamala, as you all know is smart, she’s tough, she’s experienced, she’s a proven fighter for the backbone of this country, the middle class, for all those who are struggling to get into the middle class. Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls. She’s ready to do this job on Day One and we’re both ready to get to work, rebuilding this nation and building it better. As attorney general of the largest state in the country, Kamala took on the big banks over mortgage fraud and won. Took on big oil that wanted to pollute without consequences. She was a pioneer in marriage equality and tackled the gun lobby. You know, we’ve all watched her in the United States Senate go toe to toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that needed to be asked and not stopping until she got an answer and when none was forthcoming it was obvious what the answer was. 
As a member of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee, she’s been the center, in the middle of the most critical national security challenges our country faces. Well aware, well aware of all the threats to this nation and ready to respond to them. As a child of immigrants, she knows personally how immigrant families enrich our country as well as the challenges of what it means to grow up black and Indian-American in the United States of America. Her story is America’s story, different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials. She has worked hard, she has never backed down from a challenge, and she has earned each and every of the accolades and achievements that she has gained. Many of them often in the face of obstacles that others put in her way but never quit, and this morning, all across the nation, little girls woke up, especially little black and brown girls, who so often feel overlooked and undervalued in their communities, but today, today just maybe, they’re seeing themselves for the first time in a new way, as the stuff of presidents and vice presidents. 
In her campaign in the primary, Kamala often talked about what she referred to as the 3:00 a.m. agenda, about moms and dads awake late at night in their kitchens, worried, scared, uncertain about how they were going to take care of their families, about how they were going to pay the bills, about how they were going to make it, simply make it. Growing up in Scranton and Claymont, Delaware, I saw that struggle with my family as well. Kamala saw it with hers as well and millions of Americans are living that struggle as we speak, especially in this moment of crisis, especially with so many jobs lost. Kamala and I both know that all folks are looking for as my dad would say is an even shot, just give me a shot, a fair shot, a shot at making it and it will be the work of our administration to make sure they get a fair shot. 
Working families need someone on their side in this nation because they certainly don’t have anyone in the president now on their side. That’s going to change in a Biden-Harris administration. It’s going to be gratifying to see the strong, enthusiastic reaction to Senator Harris as our next vice president. It comes from people all over the country, it’s already occurring. All over the country, all ideological views, all backgrounds. Events of course, we are predictable, some of them. It comes from all over except of course from Donald Trump’s White House and his allies. You all knew it was coming. You could have set your watches to it. Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala “nasty”, whining about how she is “mean” to his appointees. It’s no surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. 
Is anyone surprised Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman or strong women across the board? We know that more is to come, so let’s be clear. If you’re a working person, worried about whether or not you have a job to go to, whether or not you’ll be able to pay your mortgage, pay your rent, worried about the poison in the air you breathe, the water you drink, worried about your civil rights, even your basic right to dignity which is under attack with this administration, Kamala Harris has had your back and now we have to have her back. She’s going to stand with me in this campaign and all of us are going to stand up for her. On January 20, 2021, we’re all going to watch Senator Harris raise her right hand and swear the oath of office as the first woman ever to serve in the second highest office in America in this land, and then we’re going to get to work, fixing the mess that President Trump and Vice President Pence have created, both at home and abroad through four years of mismanagement and coddling of terrorists and thugs around the world. Not only will America dig itself out of this hole they put us in, we’re going to build. We’re going to build back and we’re going to build back better. We have a public health crisis. While he’s in court trying to do away with health care, with more than five million reported infections, 165,000 people dead and climbing as a consequence of COVID-19 and still, months later, no real leadership or plan from the President of the United States how to get this pandemic under control. No real help for the states and local governments trying to fill the vacuum of leadership from the White House. No real help for children and educators, for small businesses and frontline workers, they’re the ones that are holding our country together. Instead, he’s issuing executive orders and making promises that in the end will defund the Social Security system while insisting that this virus will disappear. 
The Joe Biden and Kamala Harris administration will have a comprehensive plan to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. Masking, clear science-based guidance, dramatically scaling up testing, getting states and local governments the resources they need to open the schools and businesses safely. We can do this. We just need a president and vice president willing to lead and take responsibility. Not as this president says, “It’s not my fault. The governor should thank me more.” As that old saying goes, give me a break. We have an economic crisis and more than 16 million Americans, 16 million, still out of work. Donald Trump is on track to break another record. On track to leave office with the worst jobs records of any American president in modern history, but instead of doing the hard work, of meeting face to face with congressional leaders, Democrats and Republicans in the White House like every other president has done in a crisis, to get Americans the relief they need and deserve, Donald Trump is on the golf course. If I told you this three years ago you’d look at me like I was being crazy. He hasn’t even met with the leadership. He doesn’t have time it appears. 
We have a climate crisis that Donald Trump refuses to even acknowledge. When he thinks about climate change, all we hear is the word hoax. A Biden-Harris administration is going to meet the climate crisis, protect the health of the American public. Along the way, we’re going to deliver one word, jobs. Good paying jobs. We have a racial justice crisis. Donald Trump seeks only to inflame it with his politics of racist rhetoric and appeals to division. Today’s not only the day I’m proud to introduce Senator Kamala Harris as the vice presidential nominee of the Democratic Party. It’s also the third anniversary of that terrible day in Charlottesville. Remember? Remember what it felt like to see those neo-Nazis, close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming 
… close your eyes, and those Klansmen, white supremacists, coming out of fields, carrying lighted torches, faces contorted, bulging veins, pouring into the streets of a historic American city, spewing the same antisemitic bile we heard in Hitler’s Germany in the ’30s. Remember how it felt to see a violent clash ensue between those celebrating hate and those standing against it? It was a wake up call for all of us as a country. For me, it was a call to action. My father used to say, silence is complicity, not original to him, but he believed it. At that moment, I knew I couldn’t stand by and let Donald Trump, a man who went on to say when asked about what he thought he said, there were very fine people on both sides, “Very fine people on both sides.” No president of the United States of America has ever said anything like that, see him continuing to attack everything that makes America America. I knew we were in the battle for the soul of the nation. That’s when I decided to run. I’m proud now to have Senator Harris at my side in that battle because she shares with the same intensity I do, for she’s someone who knows what’s at stake. 
The question is for all Americans to answer, who are we as a nation? What do we stand for? And most importantly, what do we want to be? Someone who knows that the future of this country is limited only by the barriers we place on our own imaginations because there’s nothing Americans cannot achieve what we put our minds to it and we do it together. 
One of the reasons I chose Kamala is because we both believe that we can define America simply in one word, possibilities. Possibilities. Let me say it again, possibilities. That’s America. That’s what sets this nation apart, is that everyone, everyone, the ability for everyone, and we mean everyone, to go as far and dream as big as hard work and their God-given ability will take them. 
When I agreed to serve as President Obama’s running mate, he asked me a number of questions, as I’ve asked Kamala, but the most important was he asked me, what I wanted most importantly. I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions. That’s what I asked Kamala, I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room, to always tell me the truth, which she will, challenge my assumptions if she disagrees, ask the hard questions because that’s the way we make the best decisions for the American people. I got a chance to spend some time at my home today with Kamala and Doug, and I want to thank them. I thanked them then, but thank them publicly for agreeing to join and take this journey with Jill and me. Doug, you’re going to have to learn what it means to be a barrier breaker yourself in this job you’re about to take on, America’s first Second Gentlemen. And although they’re not with us here today, I want to thank Ella and Cole as well. 
I had a chance to speak to Doug’s mom and dad, and Ella and Cole, and we’re going to get our kids together to let them know what’s coming. My grandchildren are about the age of their children. I got to speak to them. My campaign has always been a family affair, every campaign I’ve run. So I’ve got some news for you, you’re all honorary Bidens. And here’s the best part, Kamala, you’ve been an honorary Biden for quite some time. 
I came first to know who Kamala was through our son, Beau Biden. They were friends. They served as attorneys general at the same time. They took on the same big fights together, Kamala in California, Beau here in Delaware. Big fights that helped change the entire country. I know how much Beau respected Kamala and her work, and that mattered a lot to me, to be honest with you, as I made this decision. So now we need to get to work, pulling this nation out of these crises we find ourselves in, getting our economy back on track, uniting this nation, and yes, winning the battle for the soul of America. My fellow Americans, now let me introduce to you for the first time, your next vice president of the United States, Kamala Harris. Kamala, the floor is yours. 
[inaudible 00:35:57] Thank you, Joe. 
Thank you. 
Thank you, Joe. As I said, Joe, when you called me, I am incredibly honored by this responsibility and I’m ready to get to work. I’m ready to get to work. 
After the most competitive primary in history, the country received a resounding message that Joe was the person to lead us forward. Joe, I’m so proud to stand with you. I do so mindful of all the heroic and ambitious women before me whose sacrifice, determination and resilience makes my presence here today even possible. This is a moment of real consequence for America. Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it’s all on the line. We’re reeling from the worst public health crisis in a century. The president’s mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression and we’re experiencing a moral reckoning with racism and systemic injustice that has brought a new coalition of conscience to the streets of our country, demanding change. America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. A president who is making every challenge we face even more difficult to solve. 
But here’s the good news, we don’t have to accept the failed government of Donald Trump and Mike Pence in just 83 days. We have a chance to choose a better future for our country. So Joe, Dr. Biden, thank you for the trust you’ve placed in me. Jill, I know you will be an incredible First Lady. My husband, Doug, and I are so grateful to become a part of your extended family. 
Ever since I received Joe’s call, I’ve been thinking, yes, about the first Biden that I really came to know, and that of course is Joe’s beloved son, one of his beloved sons, Beau. In the midst of the Great Recession, Beau and I spoke on the phone practically every day, sometimes multiple times a day, working together to win back billions of dollars for homeowners from the big banks of the nation that were foreclosing on people’s homes. 
Let me just tell you about Beau Biden. I learned quickly that Beau was the kind of guy who inspired people to be a better version of themselves. He really was the best of us. And when I would ask him, “Where did you get that? Where did this come from?” He’d always talk about his dad. I will tell you the love that they shared was incredible to watch. It was the most beautiful display of the love between a father and a son. Beau talked about how Joe would spend four hours every day riding the rails back and forth from Wilmington to Washington so he could make breakfast for his kids in the morning and make it home in time to tuck them in bed each night. All of this so two little boys, who had just lost their mom and their sister in a tragic accident, would know that the world was still turning, and that’s how I came to know Joe. 
He’s someone whose first response when things get tough is never to think about himself, but to care for everyone else. He’s someone who never asks, why is this happening to me? And instead asks, what can I do to make life better for you? His empathy, his compassion, his sense of duty to care for others is why I am so proud to be on this ticket. 
Joe and I, yes, we are cut from the same cloth, family is everything to me too. I cannot wait for America to get to know my husband, Doug, and our amazing kids, Cole and Ella. Because whether I’m cheering in the bleachers at a swim meet, or setting up a college room dorm, or helping my goddaughter prepare for her school debate, or building Legos with my godson, or hugging my two baby nieces, or cooking dinner, Sunday dinner, my family means everything to me. I’ve had a lot of titles over my career, and certainly vice president will be great, but Mamala will always be the one that means the most. 
My mother and father, they came from opposite sides of the world to arrive in America, one from India and the other from Jamaica, in search of a world-class education. But what brought them together was the civil rights movement of the 1960s. That’s how they met, as students in the streets of Oakland, marching and shouting for this thing called justice in a struggle that continues today, and I was part of it. My parents would bring me to protests, strapped tightly in my stroller. My mother, Shyamala, raised my sister, Maya, and me to believe that it was up to us and every generation of Americans to keep on marching. She’d tell us, “Don’t sit around and complain about things, do something.” So I did something, I devoted my life to making real the words carved in the United States Supreme Court, equal justice under law. 
30 years ago, I stood before a judge for the first time, breathed deep and uttered the phrase that would truly guide my career and the rest of my career, Kamala Harris for the people. The people, that’s who I represented as district attorney, fighting on behalf of victims who needed help. The people, that’s who I fought for as California’s Attorney General when I took on transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings. And it’s the people who I have fought for as the United States Senator where I’ve worked every day to hold Trump officials accountable to the American people. And the people are who Joe and I will fight for every day in the White House. 
Let me tell you, as somebody who has presented my fair share of arguments in court, the case against Donald Trump and Mike Pence is open and shut. Just look where they’ve gotten us, more than 16 million out of work, millions of kids who cannot go back to school, a crisis of poverty, of homelessness afflicting black, brown, and indigenous people the most, a crisis of hunger afflicting one in five mothers who have children that are hungry and tragically, more than 165,000 lives that have been cut short, many with loved ones who never got the chance to say goodbye. It didn’t have to be this way. Six years ago, in fact, we had a different health crisis, it was called Ebola. We all remember that pandemic, but you know what happened then? Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job, only two- 
… and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died. Two. That is what’s called leadership. But compare that to the moment we find ourselves in now. When other countries are following the science, Trump pushed miracle cures he saw on Fox News. While other countries were flattening the curve, he said the virus would just poof, go away, quote, like a miracle. So when other countries opened back up for business, what did we do? We had to shut down again. This virus has impacted almost every country, but there’s a reason it has hit America worse than any other advanced nation. It’s because of Trump’s failure to take it seriously from the start, his refusal to get testing up and running, his flip flopping on social distancing and wearing masks, his delusional belief that he knows better than the experts. 
All of that is reason. And the reason that an American dies of COVID-19 every 80 seconds. It’s why countless businesses have had to shut their doors for good. It’s why there is complete chaos over when and how to reopen our schools. Mothers and fathers are confused and uncertain and angry about childcare and the safety of their kids at school. Whether they will be in danger if they go, or fall behind if they don’t. Trump is also the reason millions of Americans are now unemployed. He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground. Because of Trump’s failures of leadership, our economy has taken one of the biggest hits out of all the major industrialized nations with an unemployment rate that has tripled as of today. This is what happens when we elect a guy who just isn’t up for the job. Our country ends up in tatters, and so does our reputation around the world. 
But let’s be clear. This election isn’t just about defeating Donald Trump or Mike Pence. It’s about building this country back better. And that’s exactly what Joe and I will do. We’ll create millions of jobs and fight climate change through a clean energy revolution, bring back critical supply chains so the future is made in America, build on the affordable care act. So everyone has a peace of mind that comes with health insurance, and finally offer caregivers the dignity, the respect, and the pay they deserve. We’ll protect a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own body, root out systemic racism in our justice system, and pass a new voting rights act. A John Lewis voting rights act that will ensure every voice is heard and every voice is counted. 
The civil rights struggle is nothing new to Joe. It’s why he got into public service. It’s why he helped reauthorize the voting rights act and restore unemployment discrimination and employment discrimination laws. And today, he takes his place in the ongoing story of America’s march toward equality and justice, as the only, as the only who has served alongside the first black president and has chosen the first black woman as his running mate. But as Joe always points out, this election is about more than politics. It’s about who we are as a country. And I’ll admit over the past four years, there have been moments when I have truly worried about our future. But whenever I think that there is a reason for doubt, whenever I’ve had my own doubts, I think of you, the American people, the doctors and nurses and frontline workers who are risking your lives to save others, the truck drivers and the workers in grocery stores, in factories, in farms, working there, putting your own safety on the line to help us get through this pandemic. The women and students taking to the streets in unprecedented numbers. The dreamers and immigrants who know that families belong together. The LGBTQ Americans who know that love is love. People of every age and color and creed who are finally declaring in one voice that yes, black lives matter. 
All across this country, a whole new generation of children is growing up hearing the cries for justice and the chance of hope on which I was raised. Some strapped into strollers of their own. And trust me, it’s a song you’ll never forget. So to everyone, keeping up the fight, you are doing something. You are doing something great. You are the heroes of our time and you are the reason I know we are going to bring our country closer to realizing its great promise, but to do it, we’ll need to work, organize and vote like never before, because we need more than a victory on November 3rd. We need a mandate that proves that the past few years do not represent who we are or who we aspire to be. 
Joe likes to say that character is on the ballot. And it’s true. When he saw what happened in Charlottesville three years ago today, he knew we were in a battle for the soul of our nation. And together with your help, that’s a battle we will win. Earlier this year, I said, “I do whatever Joe asks me to do.” And so now I’m asking you to do the same. So visit joebiden.com to get involved in this campaign and vote, because electing Joe Biden is just the start of the work ahead of us. And I couldn’t be prouder to be by his side, running to represent you, the people. Thank you and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you."
